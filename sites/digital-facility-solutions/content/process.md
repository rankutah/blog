## 1. Scanning

Hard-copy drawings are scanned into high-resolution PDF format by a qualified third-party reprographics provider, coordinated by the client or recommended by Digital Facility Solutions.

- All original paper documents are returned to the owner immediately after scanning.
- If drawings have already been scanned, the existing digital files are securely transferred to Digital Facility Solutions.

## 2. Enhancement & Organization

The resulting PDF files are digitally enhanced and organized. Each file is processed to include:

- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for digitally created text
  - Handwritten text on Mylar or Duralar is typically not machine-readable.
- Page labels based on original disciplines and drawing numbers
- A hyperlinked index / table of contents for rapid navigation
- Full file-level and content-level searchability by discipline
- Image skew and alignment correction, where required

Files are organized to match the original project drawing index or sheet order whenever available.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of what the output looks like in practice.

## 3. Delivery

The completed, digitally enhanced drawing set is returned to the customer on a flash drive or other preferred media in a structured, searchable format—ready for daily operations, maintenance, and future projects.

Archived documents can be retrieved in just a few clicks.
