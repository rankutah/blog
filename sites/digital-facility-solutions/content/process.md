## What’s the process for blueprint scanning and digitizing blueprints?

### 1. You send your pdf files to us

If you only have physical formats, don’t worry. We can help with those, too. We’ll work with a qualified third-party reprographics provider for large format scanning so your oversized sheets become high-resolution PDFs.

If you’ve shared original paper documents with us, we return them to you immediately after scanning.

### 2. We digitally enhance and organize each drawing set

- Optical Character Recognition for digitally created text. (Handwritten text on Mylar or Duralar is typically not machine-readable)
- Correct page labels by discipline and drawing number.
- Hyperlinked index and table of contents.
- Full file-level and content-level searchability by discipline.
- Image alignment and skew correction for crooked images.

### 3. We organize your files

Files are organized to match the original drawing index.

### 4. We return your files

Files are returned in a structured, searchable format** ready for you to use in your daily operations, maintenance, and future projects.

You can then retrieve your archived documents in just a few clicks!
