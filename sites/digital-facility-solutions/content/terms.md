# Terms of Service

Last updated: {{< year >}}

Please read these terms before using Digital Facility Solutions services. By requesting work, approving a quote, or receiving deliverables, you agree to these terms.

## Services and deliverables

- We provide digitization and organization of facility documentation (for example: scanning coordination, OCR/searchability, indexing, hyperlinking, and structured deliverables).
- Deliverables, formats, and timelines will be defined in the quote or written agreement.

## Estimates and approvals

- We provide an estimate before work begins.
- If additional scope is discovered (for example: additional plan sets, added disciplines, missing pages, or special formatting requirements), we will request approval before proceeding.

## Client-provided materials

- You are responsible for providing materials you have the right to share (paper drawings, PDFs, CAD exports, photos, notes, and related files).
- For best results, you agree to provide complete and accurate information about the project and desired outcomes.

## Delivery and revisions

- Delivery method (download link, shared drive, etc.) will be agreed in advance.
- Reasonable revisions to correct errors in our work are included when reported within a reasonable time after delivery.
- Revisions due to changes in scope or new inputs may require additional fees.

## Payments

- Payment terms are defined in the quote or invoice.
- Unless otherwise agreed, payment is due upon delivery.

## Confidentiality

- We treat client documents as confidential and use them only to perform the requested work.
- If you require a formal NDA, we can provide one upon request.

## Data and backups

- You are responsible for maintaining backups of your original records.
- While we take care to preserve and handle your materials and files appropriately, Digital Facility Solutions is not responsible for data loss caused by factors outside our control.

## Liability

- To the fullest extent permitted by law, Digital Facility Solutions’ total liability for any claim is limited to the amount you paid for the service related to the claim.
- We are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages.

## Privacy

- Please see our [Privacy Policy](/privacy/) to understand how we collect and use information.

## Changes
