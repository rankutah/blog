Convert your paper drawings, PDFs, and scattered archives into a clean, organized system your maintenance team, contractors, and inspectors can search and use with confidence.

## Transform Your Building Plans



Static plan sets are hard to use during real work. Digital Facility Solutions converts fragmented and disorganized building records into a reliable, operational asset that supports maintenance, capital planning, and day-to-day facility operations.

## The Benefits

Clients typically recover the cost of Digital Facility Solutions services by:

- Avoiding contractor re-surveys
- Reducing change orders
- Speeding emergency repairs
- Improving maintenance response
- Preserving institutional knowledge

One avoided change order often exceeds the cost of the entire service.

## What We Do

By converting legacy drawings into a structured, searchable, and navigable digital system, we help organizations reduce downtime, eliminate contractor guesswork, and preserve critical institutional knowledge.

This approach delivers measurable savings by reducing:

- Owner time spent searching for or recreating drawings
- Costly change orders caused by missing or inaccurate information
- Emergency repair disruptions and response delays
- Technician time lost hunting for documents
- Repeat site surveys and redundant field investigations
- Unforeseen conditions
