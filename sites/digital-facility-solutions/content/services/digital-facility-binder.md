## What you get

Digital Facility Solutions converts fragmented and disorganized building records into a reliable, operational asset that supports maintenance, capital planning, and day-to-day facility operations.

Each drawing set is processed to include:

- OCR text recognition for digitally created text
  - Handwritten text on Mylar or Duralar is typically not machine-readable.
- Page labels based on original disciplines and drawing numbers
- A hyperlinked index / table of contents for rapid navigation
- Full file-level and content-level searchability by discipline
- Image skew and alignment correction where required

Files are organized to match the original project drawing index or sheet order whenever available.

## Why it matters

This approach reduces downtime, eliminates contractor guesswork, and preserves critical institutional knowledge.

## The benefits

Clients typically recover the cost of Digital Facility Solutions services by:

- Avoiding contractor re-surveys
- Reducing change orders
- Speeding emergency repairs
- Improving maintenance response
- Preserving institutional knowledge

One avoided change order often exceeds the cost of the entire service.

## What we do

By converting legacy drawings into a structured, searchable, and navigable digital system, we help organizations reduce downtime, eliminate contractor guesswork, and preserve critical institutional knowledge.

This approach delivers measurable savings by reducing:

- Owner time spent searching for or recreating drawings
- Costly change orders caused by missing or inaccurate information
- Emergency repair disruptions and response delays
- Technician time lost hunting for documents
- Repeat site surveys and redundant field investigations
- Unforeseen conditions
