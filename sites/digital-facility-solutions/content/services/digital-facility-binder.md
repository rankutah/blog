## What you get

Digital Facility Solutions converts fragmented and disorganized building records into a reliable, operational asset that supports maintenance, capital planning, and day-to-day facility operations.

Each drawing set is processed to include:

- OCR text recognition for digitally created text
  - Handwritten text on Mylar or Duralar is typically not machine-readable.
- Page labels based on original disciplines and drawing numbers
- A hyperlinked index / table of contents for rapid navigation
- Full file-level and content-level searchability by discipline
- Image skew and alignment correction where required

## Why it matters

This approach reduces downtime, eliminates contractor guesswork, and preserves critical institutional knowledge.
