# Consulting & Gutter Repair

We audit, diagnose, and repair gutter & drainage issues: structural support, hydraulic capacity, leak remediation, aesthetic restoration, and preventive upgrades.

## Common Gutter Problems We Fix

{{< problem title="Overflow & Debris" icon="clogged" img="/media/overflow & debris.png" alt="Overflowing gutter filled with leaves and debris" problem="Leaves, pine needles, and shingle granules clog high‑volume roof valleys leading to spill‑over, fascia rot, landscape wash‑out, and staining." solution="Profile‑matched guards, valley diverters, added / upsized downspouts, plus scheduled seasonal clearing keep flow within design capacity." >}}

{{< problem title="Sagging Sections" icon="sagging" img="/media/sagging sections.png" alt="Sagging gutter section demonstrating improper support" problem="Hanger failure or under‑spaced brackets cause the gutter to dip; water pools, joints stress, and overflow occurs at low points." solution="Audit spacing, replace failed hangers with heavy‑duty types, re‑establish correct pitch (1/16–1/8 in per ft) and add reinforcement at transitions." >}}

{{< problem title="Leak Points" icon="leak" img="/media/leak points.png" alt="Illustration of common gutter leak points" problem="Drips at miters, endcaps, outlets, and seams stain siding and erode soil near the foundation." solution="Clean & dry joints, re‑seal with long‑life elastomeric or rivet + seal system; add splash control and confirm continuous pitch for shedding." >}}

{{< problem title="Loose / Pulling Away" icon="loose" img="/media/loose pulling away.png" alt="Gutter pulling away from fascia showing fastener failure" problem="Fasteners backed out from fascia movement or improper install allow gutter to detach under load (storm water + debris)." solution="Refasten into sound substrate, replace compromised fascia sections, upgrade to hidden hangers / structural screws, and isolate galvanic reactions." >}}

{{< problem title="Drainage Capacity" icon="drain" img="/media/drainage capacity.png" alt="Diagram showing improved gutter drainage capacity" problem="Too few or undersized downspouts concentrate flow; water overtops during intense Florida downpours." solution="Hydraulic assessment: add outlets, convert to larger profile or 3x4 downspouts, shorten horizontal runs, and diffuse discharge away from slab." >}}

{{< problem title="Underground Clogs" icon="underground" img="/media/underground clogs.png" alt="Graphic of underground drain clog scenario" problem="Buried extensions accumulate sediment, leaf slurry, or root intrusion slowing discharge and forcing backup at the gutter outlet." solution="Camera inspection, hydro‑jet or mechanical clean, install accessible clean‑outs & filter boxes, and apply root barrier where intrusion is recurring." >}}


## How Our Consulting Works

We begin with a full visual + drainage assessment (roof edge, hangers, pitch, downspout termination, underground routing). You receive a prioritized action report: immediate fixes, preventive upgrades, and aesthetic enhancements. Implementation can be phased to match your budget.
