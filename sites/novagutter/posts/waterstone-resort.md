# Waterstone Resort & Marina Project in Boca Raton, FL

![](/media/seamless-gutters-boca-raton-fl-new-pics1.jpg)

As one of Boca Raton’s premier waterfront properties, the Waterstone Resort and Marina is an iconic fixture in the South Florida region drawing thousands of tourists each and every year. Needless to say, the property managers wanted to be sure they hired the top Boca Raton gutter company when they started having issues with leaking.

The existing gutters had been leaking onto the hotel's outside courtyard. They were not standard gutters in any way and had to be removed/installed using a boom lift. Once the old gutters were safely removed, the new gutters were installed underneath.

Most gutter companies wouldn't even touch this job but our team of commercial gutter installation professionals was well equipped and used to doing jobs like these that are out of the norm. The job was completed flawlessly and the luxurious Four-Diamond boutique hotel was able to return to normal business operations immediately.
