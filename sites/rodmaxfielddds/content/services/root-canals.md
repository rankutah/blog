# Root Canals

Root canals treat diseased and dying teeth. When the pulp (the tooth’s blood supply and nerve) becomes infected, the pulp is removed and the canal is thoroughly disinfected. The canal is then filled with gutta‑percha points coated in a therapeutic medication. A temporary filling seals the tooth until a permanent [crown](/services/crowns/) can be made.

### Why does the pulp get infected?

- Untreated cavities that extend into the pulp
- Old fillings or crowns that break, allowing bacteria to leak underneath
- Facial trauma that damages the pulp

Root canal therapy typically takes up to two appointments to complete. In most cases, a protective crown will be placed a few weeks later.

### What happens next?

Once the root canal is finished, that tooth will need a [crown](/services/crowns/). We’ll place a temporary crown and take impressions to send to our lab. The final crown is usually ready in about two weeks.

### Symptoms of diseased or dying pulp

- Visible swelling
- Sensitivity to temperature
- Pain in the tooth itself and the surrounding gums
- Visible trauma (for example, a broken tooth)

If you experience any of these symptoms, please [contact us](/contact/). Abscesses pose a serious health risk—waiting to get treatment only lets the problem worsen.
