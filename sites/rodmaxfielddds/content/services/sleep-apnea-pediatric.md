Pediatric sleep apnea is very similar to adult sleep apnea, however there are a few differences. Adults will usually experience daytime sleepiness, while children are more likely to have behavioral issues. Obesity is one major cause of adult sleep apnea and can play a role in pediatric sleep apnea as well. But the most common cause of pediatric sleep apnea is enlarged tonsils and adenoids.

Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent complications that may affect children’s growth, cognitive development, and behavior. Pediatric sleep apnea should not be left untreated.
