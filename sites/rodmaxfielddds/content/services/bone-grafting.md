When a tooth is extracted, bone loss occurs rapidly. Up to 50% of the bone height and width will likely be lost within the first six months. Without intervention bone loss will continue. This makes it difficult or sometimes impossible to wear [dentures](/services/dentures/), and can disqualify you as a candidate for [implants](/services/implants/). However, bone loss after an extraction can be prevented. If graft material is placed into the site soon after the tooth has been removed, little to no bone loss will occur.

### Material

The graft material used in our office is a particulate collected from a cadaver. In some cases, we also use porcine bone particulate. Both types of graft materials are re-hydrated before placement, usually with the serum collected from the [PRF](/services/prf/). This helps your body to accept the graft since it recognizes the serum as its own cells. Finally the graft material is covered with a membrane which essentially acts as a lid to seal the particulate in while the site heals.
