# Gum Disease

Gum disease (periodontal disease) is an infection of the tissues that support your teeth. It is caused by plaque and tartar buildup that irritate the gums. Early detection and consistent home care—combined with professional cleanings—can prevent progression and help protect your teeth and bone.

## Stage 1: Gingivitis

Gingivitis is the earliest stage of gum disease. It is reversible, but only with the proper treatment. The symptoms of gingivitis include swollen and tender gums; gums that bleed while brushing, flossing, or sometimes when eating hard foods; and persistent bad breath.

## Stage 2: Periodontitis

Periodontitis, or Stage 2 gum disease, is irreversible gum disease. At this point, the infection has compromised the supporting structures around the teeth. The attachment of the gums to the teeth will deteriorate, and gum tissues may begin to recede. Bone loss may also occur. The gums will be sensitive and bleed when brushing and flossing; hard foods may also cause discomfort and bleeding. Persistent bad breath is also a sign of periodontitis.

## Stage 3: Advanced Periodontitis

Stage 3 of gum disease is Advanced Periodontitis; it has many of the same symptoms of gingivitis and periodontitis. At this point in gum disease, teeth can become mobile and shift—in some cases teeth may even need to be removed.

## Preventing Gum Disease

In dentistry, prevention is key! Preventing gum disease is simply a matter of creating good hygiene habits. By getting back to basics and scheduling regular cleaning appointments, gum disease can often be avoided.
