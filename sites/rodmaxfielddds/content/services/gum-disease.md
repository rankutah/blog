# Gum Disease

Fluoride is a mineral that is found in all natural water sources. When used correctly, fluoride is a very effective preventative tool. It remineralizes tooth enamel, creating stronger teeth and greater resistance to decay. Fluoride can be used topically or in the form of supplemental tablets. Supplements can be prescribed for kids ages six months to 16 years if they are high risk for decay or if their drinking water is too low in fluoride.

## Stage 1: Gingivitis

Gingivitis is the earliest stage of gum disease. It is reversible, but only with the proper treatment. The symptoms of gingivitis include swollen and tender gums; gums that bleed while brushing, flossing, or sometimes when eating hard foods; and persistent bad breath.

## Stage 2: Periodontitis

Periodontitis, or Stage 2 gum disease, is irreversible gum disease. At this point, the infection has compromised the supporting structures around the teeth. The attachment of the gums to the teeth will deteriorate, and gum tissues may begin to recede. Bone loss may also occur. The gums will be sensitive and bleed when brushing and flossing; hard foods may also cause discomfort and bleeding. Persistent bad breath is also a sign of periodontitis.

## Stage 3: Advanced Periodontitis

Stage 3 of gum disease is Advanced Periodontitis; it has all of the same symptoms of gingivitis and periodontitis. At this point in gum disease, teeth can become mobile and shift–in some cases teeth may even need to be removed.

## Preventing Gum Disease

In dentistry, prevention is key! Preventing gum disease is simply a matter of creating good hygiene habits. By getting back to basics and scheduling regular cleaning appointments, gum disease can be easily avoided!
