## Why Custom Mouth Guards?

Custom mouth guards provide much stronger protection than generic ones from the local drugstore. The cheap “boil-and-bite” type mouth guards are inadequate for most people. With custom mouth guards, athletes can easily drink and talk while wearing them. They are available in a variety of colors, and can be made to look invisible.

## Purpose

Some of our worst cases are people who were somehow hit in the face while not wearing a mouth guard. Without a mouth guard, teeth can be knocked out or broken. Mouth guards also help prevent biting through your lips or cheeks.

## When to Wear?

You should always wear a mouth guard while playing sports or during any physical activity. This includes everyone from football players, to wakeboarders, to cheerleaders. Athletes who play full-contact sports of course run the risk of facial injury. It is not uncommon for a wakeboarder to get hit in the face by their board during a wipeout. Cheerleaders are frequently elbowed or kicked in the face during stunts. Wearing a mouth guard will help prevent serious oral injury.
