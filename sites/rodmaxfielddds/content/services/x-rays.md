# X-Rays

For your safety and convenience, our office uses state-of-the-art digital x-rays that expose our patients to far less radiation than traditional film. At your first exam, we will take a full-mouth series of x-rays. This allows us to see each tooth from multiple angles, and is a very thorough exam. We will not do this again for three to five years. At subsequent annual exams, four bite wing x-rays are usually sufficient.

## Panoramic X-Rays

A panoramic x-ray shows the entire jaw in one image. It helps us identify any developmental abnormalities, and determine when the wisdom teeth are ready to come out. Panoramic x-rays are also useful for planning out orthodontic treatment.

## Intraoral Photos

Before beginning procedures, we will take an intraoral photo of the tooth being treated. An intraoral photo is a basic picture of a specific tooth; it provides an easily-understandable visual that helps us better explain your dental needs.
Intraoral photos are required by many insurances for “proof of necessity of care” before coverage will be provided. However, intraoral photos themselves are not covered by insurance.
