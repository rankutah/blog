# Laser Treatment

In our office we have a DEKA CO2 laser. It can be used for anything from cauterizing bleeding to treating localized gum disease. Dr. Maxfield frequently uses the laser to re-contour the tissues surrounding the site when placing implants or when preparing a tooth for a crown. It is highly effective at eliminating bacteria, and can also be used to treat canker sores and cold sores.
