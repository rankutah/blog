Most dentistry looks like dentistry. Our goal is to provide dentistry that is undetectable. The crown material that we typically use is a high-grade porcelain that looks and feels like your natural teeth.

### Treatment Process

A crown requires at least two visits to our office. Initially, we will remove all decay, shape the tooth, and fit it with a temporary crown of either plastic or metal.

On the subsequent visit we will remove the temporary crown, then fit and adjust the permanent crown. Finally, we will cement the crown into place and you will have a beautiful new tooth.

### When Are Crowns Necessary?

Crowns are necessary when decay has progressed to the point that a filling will no longer suffice. The root of the tooth is still healthy, but the visible part of the tooth is severely decayed and/or broken. Crowns are used to restore the tooth to its natural appearance and function.

If an old filling breaks, and the damage is too great to simply replace it, a crown may be used to treat the tooth.
