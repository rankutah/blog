## Process

For years now, Dr. Maxfield has had great success using platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) in regenerative procedures. Platelets and fibrin are components of blood which form bio-active clots to promote healing.
We will draw a few vials of blood from your arm and spin them in a centrifuge to separate the blood components. At the top of the vial is a yellowish fluid; this is plasma. The bottom two-thirds of the vial holds a thick, viscous “slug” made up of fibrin and red blood cells.

Once the vials have been through the centrifuge, the plasma serum is siphoned off into a syringe for later use. The “slug” is then removed from the vial and the red blood cells are trimmed away from the fibrin. The fibrin clot is then placed into a metal container and compressed. The compression of the fibrin flattens it out, into a membrane.

Once the fibrin has been flattened into a membrane, Dr. Maxfield will place it into an extraction site or over the top of a bone graft to enhance healing. Because the membrane is made from your body’s own cells, there is no chance of rejection.

Once the procedure is finished, the plasma serum that was siphoned from the vials is injected into the surrounding tissues. The fibrin clot and serum essentially kick-start the healing process because your body recognizes the cells as its own.

## Benefits
- Less inflammation and pain post-surgery
- Faster healing
- No risk of rejection
- Reduced risk of dry socket post-extraction
