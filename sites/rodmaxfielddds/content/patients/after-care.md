## Crowns & Bridges (Also Inlays and Onlays) {#crowns-bridges}

These restorations require two appointments: first to prep the tooth and place a temporary crown, and second to place the permanent crown.

TEMPORARY CROWNS AND BRIDGES (also inlays and onlays)

- Do not chew anything until the numbness is gone.
- It is normal for gums to be sore after a crown/bridge procedure. Mouth rinses such as Listerine or Scope may be helpful in the healing process. Use as directed.
- Be sure to brush gently around the temporary crown/bridge each day.
- Floss down between the opposing teeth, but pull the floss out the side instead of back up as this might pull off the temporary crown/bridge.
- Avoid chewing on the temporary crown/bridge if possible until the permanent restoration is cemented.
- Temporary crowns/bridges will usually not feel like your original teeth. This is normal for the contour, color and texture to be different.
- If your temporary crown/bridge comes off, please call our office and bring the temporary crown with you so we can re-cement it. It is very important that your temporary crown/bridge stays on to avoid tooth movement.
- If pain, swelling, an uneven bite, or anything that you perceive to be abnormal occurs, contact our office immediately.

## Denture Delivery {#dentures}

- Adjusting to new dentures takes time. The gum tissue supporting the denture may develop sore spots. When this occurs, call for an appointment right away to have your dentures adjusted. Dentures often require a re-line to improve the fit and retention.
- Dentures placed immediately after the extraction of remaining teeth act as large band-aids, helping the tissue heal. Immediate dentures will definitely require additional re-lines as the extraction sites heal and the gums reduce in size.
- Dentures must be brushed twice daily to remove plaque and prevent tartar from accumulating. Be sure to take your dentures out at night to help the gums stay healthy. Store in a container or cup with water. All denture wearers must have regular check-ups.

## Fillings {#fillings}

- Avoid eating or chewing until numbness is completely gone
- Hot, cold, and pressure sensitivity is normal after your appointment. The injection site may also be sore. Over the counter pain medications should handle any discomfort.
- If temperature, pressure, bite, or any unexplained sensitivity persists, or gets worse, call our office immediately for an appointment.

## Implants {#implants}

- Avoid the surgery site as much as possible. Avoid rinsing, touching, or anything that might disturb the implant.
- Some bleeding may occur. Use gauze to stop any bleeding by simply biting on the gauze for thirty minutes. If bleeding will not stop, call our office immediately.
- Swelling is normal for any surgery. To reduce swelling, apply an ice pack on the outside of your face (where the surgery took place) for 20 minutes every hour.
- Take prescribed antibiotics as directed to prevent infection. If pain medications are prescribed, take those as directed also.
- Limit physical activity for 72 hours. If bleeding starts, discontinue activity and call our office immediately.
- Drink plenty of fluids. A diet of soft foods is recommended for the first 72 hours. As the surgery site heals, regular eating habits may be resumed.
- Good oral hygiene is critical for proper healing. Anti-microbial mouth rinses may be used twice daily. Carefully brush around the surgery site, and not directly on it until healing is complete.

## Oral Surgery {#oral-surgery}

### Implants:

- Avoid the surgery site as much as possible.  Avoid rinsing, flossing, or anything that might disturb the implant. Scroll down to see General Guidelines for Oral Surgery.

### Wisdom Teeth and Extractions:

- You will be given gauze to bite on to help in clot formation.  After approximately 30 minutes of biting on gauze, the extraction site should stop bleeding.  If not, replace the gauze and bite down another 30 minutes. Minor bleeding or “oozing” during the first 24 hours is not uncommon.
- for the next 72 hours:  Do not rinse vigorously, do not brush near the extraction site, no sucking on straws, avoid smoking or drinking alcohol, avoid chewing near extraction site, limit physical activity.
- If a blood clot is lost, a dry socket will usually develop 2-3 days following surgery and will become uncomfortable.  Call our office if pain occurs.

### General Guidelines for Oral Surgery:

- Avoid physical activity for 72 hours.
- Swelling is normal as the body heals itself.  An ice pack should be placed on the outside of the face in the areas of surgery.  Apply it 20 minutes per hour as needed.  Ice packs are recommended for the first 36 hours, after which moist heat will aid in healing.
- Pain should be controlled with prescription medication or over-the-counter medications.  Avoid driving, alcohol, or working with machinery when on prescription narcotic pain medications.
- Keep your mouth clean.  Brush gently around the teeth near the surgery site and rinse softly as not to dislodge any clots.  Avoid vigorous mouth rinsing or touching the surgical sites.
- Antibiotics should be taken as prescribed to prevent infection.
- If nausea or vomiting occurs, do not eat.  Treat the nausea with traditional over-the-counter remedies.
- Corners of the mouth can sometimes crack, requiring ointment.  Sore throats and pain when swallowing are not uncommon and will dissipate with time.
- Jaw soreness is common and will usually go away with time.
- Sutures, if used, will usually dissolve on their own unless non-dissolving sutures were used.  In this case they will be removed approximately one week from placement.

## Oral Sedation {#oral-sedation}

- Patient must not drive for 24 hours after taking sedative drugs.
- A responsible adult must stay with the patient until the effects of sedative drugs have worn off.
- Patient must not operate heavy machinery or hazardous devices for 24 hours.
- Patient must not use stairs without assistance. Have patient stay on ground floor during recovery.
- Patient must take plenty of fluids as soon as practical.
- Patient must eat as soon as practical after numbness is gone.
- Assist patient when walking, and be prepared to support all of their weight.
- Patient should not be left alone with small children who need care for at least 24 hours.

## Periodontal Therapy, Scaling and Root Planing (Deep Cleaning) {#periodontal-therapy}

- Avoid eating until numbness is gone
- Avoid eating hard foods, such as tortilla chips, potato chips, popcorn or seeds for 48 hours
- Resume your home care regimen immediately, brushing treated areas gently
- If antibiotics have been placed directly into infected areas, discontinue use of Waterpik or other oral water flosser for 14 days. Continue brushing and flossing gently.
- If prescribed, use medicated mouth rinse and/or antibiotics as directed.
- Ibuprofen (Advil/Motrin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) work well for pain.
- Do not smoke for at least 2-4 days as it can interfere with healing.
- Sensitivity to hot/cold and/or sweets is normal and should gradually resolve itself within a few weeks with proper home care. Brushing 2-3 times daily with sensitivity reducing toothpaste or using fluoride rinse usually helps. Avoid “whitening” toothpaste as it may aggravate the treated areas.

## Root Canal Treatment {#root-canal}

- During root canal treatment, the nerve, blood vessels and decay in your tooth are removed. Because the tooth loses its vascular supply, it quickly becomes brittle and subject to fracture. Because of this, a crown is highly recommended as soon as possible.
- Discomfort and swelling of the affected site may occur for several days. Tenderness to chewing may also occur and you should chew on the other side of the mouth.
- Antibiotics for infection and pain medications may be prescribed. Take them as directed.
- Drinking alcohol and/or driving should be avoided while taking narcotic pain medication.

## Sealants {#sealants}

- It is normal for the bite to feel slightly off after sealant placement. There may also be a slight aftertaste immediately following application. Rinsing with water will help remove the unwanted taste.
- You can chew normally right after sealant placement.
- Maintain good oral hygiene.
- Sealants can chip or wear out. The condition of the sealants is checked at each re-care visit.
