## No Insurance? Ask about Discount Dental Services (DDS) {#discount-plan}

If you don’t have dental insurance (or your plan’s benefits are limited), ask us about our in‑office Discount Dental Services (DDS) membership program. Every year hundreds of patients choose our Discount Dental Services (DDS) plan over other dental insurances, because it’s simply better. Ask us about our DDS plan!

## Insurance We Work With {#insurance}

We participate with and submit claims to many major dental insurance plans. Because plan details (covered services, annual maximums, deductibles) vary widely, we verify eligibility and benefits before or at your appointment when possible.

### What We Do For You
- Submit electronic claims promptly
- Provide necessary documentation (x‑rays, narratives) when requested
- Help you estimate out‑of‑pocket costs before treatment

### What Insurance Typically Does Not Cover Fully
- Cosmetic/aesthetic services
- Some implant components
- Upgraded materials where a standard alternative exists

## Contracted / In-Network Providers {#in-network}

Below is our current list of contracted providers. Network status can change; existing patient restrictions noted with an asterisk (*). Please call to confirm if you have questions about a specific plan.

- **Aetna** <br>
- **Delta Dental PPO*** (existing patients only) <br>
- **Delta Dental Premier*** (existing patients only) <br>
- **DMBA** <br>
- **Guardian** <br>
- **MetLife** <br>
- **PEHP** <br>
- **Regence Blue Cross Blue Shield** <br>
- **Select Health*** (existing patients only) <br>
- **SunLife** <br>
- **United Healthcare** <br>

> Not seeing your carrier? Call us — some plans process out-of-network with similar benefits. We’ll help you compare.

### Your Responsibility
Insurance rarely pays 100%. You are responsible for the portion insurance does not cover (co‑insurance, deductible, amounts over plan maximum). Final insurance processing may differ from estimates.

> If you have questions about coverage for a specific procedure, please call with your insurance details and we’ll help you find out.

## Submitting & Processing Claims {#claims}
1. Claim sent electronically (usually within 1–2 business days of treatment)
2. Insurance processes and issues Explanation of Benefits (EOB)
3. We apply payment to your account and bill/credit any difference

Please retain your EOB for your records—it explains how your claim was processed.

## Payment Options {#payment-options}
We offer several convenient ways to pay any portion not covered by insurance or for procedures without coverage.

### At Time of Service
- Cash
- Debit / Credit cards (most major cards)
- HSA / FSA cards (eligible services only)

### After Insurance
When insurance processes differently than estimated, we will notify you of any remaining balance and options.

### Financing
For larger treatment plans (implants, extensive restorative) we can discuss phased treatment or direct you to third‑party financing resources. Ask us for current options.

## Estimates vs Final Costs {#estimates}
Treatment estimates are based on the information available from your insurer and typical processing. Final patient responsibility may change if:
- Annual maximum is reached mid‑year
- Frequency limitations apply (e.g., cleanings, x‑rays)
- Waiting periods or downgrades affect benefits

We will communicate any material changes before proceeding with optional treatments.
