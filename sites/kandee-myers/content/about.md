## Utah Roots

My story begins in Utah. My mother grew up in Mount Pleasant, Utah, where she met my dad at Wasatch Academy. I was raised in the suburbs of Chicago and moved to Tucson, Arizona as a teenager. My early experiences came with multiple challenges which have shaped my sincere interest in people and what makes life worth living.

## Faith & Family

At 18, I made faith a central part of my life — a decision that continues to guide how I see and serve others. I married young, raised three children, and — like many Utah families — balanced church, education, and work. Of four businesses my husband and I owned, our independent bookstore was my favorite. It confirmed what I believe deeply: people are good, books make the world better, and stories have the power to heal.

## Lifelong Learning

I am a lifelong learner with a BS degree in Family Studies and Human Development and a Master’s in Applied Positive Psychology from the University of Pennsylvania, the academic study of happiness and human flourishing. A guiding principle from my graduate work comes from Chris Peterson: “Other people matter.” That simple truth has shaped both my professional and personal life.

## Housing & Trust

Since 1994 I have worked in real estate and I love it! As a licensed Broker, I built my career on trust, results, and meaningful relationships. Alongside my work with clients, I invested in rental properties, navigating market cycles, interest rates, and housing shortages firsthand. Few issues matter more to families than housing, and it has brought me great joy to spend my life’s work helping people find a place to call home.

## People & Outdoors

I love people. I love the outdoors.

Research on well-being reminds us that walking is good — and walking with a friend is even better. Walking is not only good for our bodies, but it is also good for our brains. Walking with a friend creates space for meaningful connection, which is missing today.

Over the years, I’ve been a runner and cyclist, and I’ve hiked the Grand Canyon Rim-to-Rim twice. My current passion is walking the Camino de Santiago in northern Spain — a path people have traveled for more than a thousand years.

The Camino is a powerful blend of travel, friendship, solitude, and reflection. Along its nearly 500-mile journey to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, where the remains of Saint James are traditionally believed to rest, you encounter people from around the world, rural communities, breathtaking landscapes, and moments of quiet clarity.

Our planet is sacred, and we have been given a world worth exploring. Learning from people, cultures, and the goodness that emerges outdoors is one of my greatest joys — and it keeps me curious, grounded, and grateful.
