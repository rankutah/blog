## Utah Roots

My story begins in Utah. My mother grew up in Mount Pleasant, Utah, where she met my dad at Wasatch Academy. I was raised in the suburbs of Chicago and moved to Tucson, Arizona as a teenager. My early experiences came with multiple challenges which have shaped my sincere interest in people and what makes life worth living.

## Faith & Family

At 18, I made faith a central part of my life — a decision that continues to guide how I see and serve others. I married young, raised three children, and — like many Utah families — balanced church, education, and work. Of four businesses my husband and I owned, our independent bookstore was my favorite. It confirmed what I believe deeply: people are good, books make the world better, and stories have the power to heal.

## Lifelong Learning

I am a lifelong learner with a BS degree in Family Studies and Human Development and a Master’s in Applied Positive Psychology from the University of Pennsylvania, the academic study of happiness and human flourishing. A guiding principle from my graduate work comes from Chris Peterson: “Other people matter.” That simple truth has shaped both my professional and personal life.

## Read Estate Broker

Since 1994, I’ve worked in real estate and I truly love it. Early in my career, I was honored as Rookie of the Year in Arizona and for several years now I’ve been recognized among the Top 250 REALTORS® by the Utah County Association of REALTORS®. Awards are encouraging, but it’s the people I’ve worked with that I’ve genuinely treasured.

For over 32 years, I’ve had a front-row seat to what housing really means in people’s lives. I’ve experienced the market from both sides — as an investor and as an advocate for families during market cycles, shifting interest rates, and housing shortages. I love steady work. I love solving hard problems. And I especially love being the calm voice in the room when choices feel heavy. What has remained constant is this: a home is more than a transaction. It’s stability. It’s hope. It’s where life unfolds.

Helping families build that foundation, while friendships quietly took root over the years, has made this more than a career — it has felt like a calling.

## People & Outdoors

I love people. I love the outdoors.

Research on well-being reminds us that walking is good — and walking with a friend is even better. Walking is not only good for our bodies, but it is also good for our brains. Walking with a friend creates space for meaningful connection, which is missing today.

Over the years, I’ve been a runner and cyclist, and I’ve hiked the Grand Canyon Rim-to-Rim twice. My current passion is walking the Camino de Santiago in northern Spain — a path people have traveled for more than a thousand years. The Camino is a powerful blend of travel, friendship, solitude, and reflection.

Our planet is sacred, and we have been given a world worth exploring. Learning from people, cultures, and the goodness that emerges outdoors is one of my greatest joys — and it keeps me curious, grounded, and grateful.
