# Featured priorities

## Utah Housing & Homeownership

Kandee’s background includes real estate (since 1994) and first-hand experience through the housing boom and crash.

Key points:

- Modernize Utah’s **homestead exemption** to reflect today’s home values.
- Strengthen **property-ownership protections** (including exploring optional community property approaches).
- Review whether homeowners should be exempt from **state income tax on forgiven mortgage debt** in short-sale scenarios.

## Education — Public & Private Schools

Kandee supports strong public schools and wants education policy to be research-guided and child-centered.

Key points:

- Supports **public education** and continued support for **Alpine School District**.
- Not in favor of using public **property tax dollars** to fund private schools.
- Re-evaluate **technology/screen time** during the school day; support phone-free learning spaces.
