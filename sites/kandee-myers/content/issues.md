### Utah Housing & Homeownership

Key points:

- Modernize Utah’s **homestead exemption** to reflect today’s home values.
- Strengthen **property-ownership protections** (including exploring optional community property approaches).
- Review whether homeowners should be exempt from **state income tax on forgiven mortgage debt** in short-sale scenarios.

Kandee supports strong public schools and wants education policy to be research-guided and child-centered.

Key points:

- Supports **public education** and continued support for **Alpine School District**.
- Not in favor of using public **property tax dollars** to fund private schools.
- Re-evaluate **technology/screen time** during the school day; support phone-free learning spaces.
