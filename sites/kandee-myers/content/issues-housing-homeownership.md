# Utah Housing & Homeownership

Related: [Experience You Can Trust](/issues/housing-homeownership/experience-you-can-trust/)

I have professionally sold real estate since 1994 and bought my first rental property in 1985. In 2005, my husband and I owned 20 rental properties, and some of us, deep in the real estate market at the time, could feel the uncertainty slowly building as federal banking oversight weakened.

I believe an important point is that both parties, driven by a shared belief that markets could largely self-regulate and that expanding homeownership was an unqualified good, caused “the housing bubble and crash” (2007–2009).

### Who removed the key guardrails?

- Lawmakers who deregulated finance
- Regulators who chose restraint over enforcement
- Financial institutions that exploited incentives
- Rating agencies that underestimated risk
- A culture that equated credit expansion with prosperity

My perspective is that it wasn’t malice — it was overconfidence, misaligned incentives, and a belief that housing prices would keep rising.

### 1. Protecting homeownership and property rights

- Modernize Utah’s Homestead Exemption, which currently protects only $42,000 of equity per individual homeowner — an amount that no longer reflects today’s housing market.
- Explore stronger property-ownership protections, including whether Utah should adopt community property principles or offer homeowners the option to hold property as community property.
- Examine whether homeowners should be exempt from state income tax on mortgage debt forgiven through a short sale, so individuals are not taxed on a financial loss while trying to recover and remain stable.

### 2. Expanding access to homeownership in a changing housing market

- Homeownership matters to our health, stability, and sense of belonging while strengthening communities and our state.
- Address the realities of rising home prices and rental costs by evaluating housing and property laws.
- Stay focused on practical, responsible ways to make the dream of homeownership achievable for more Utahns.

### 3. Property taxes

More to come.
