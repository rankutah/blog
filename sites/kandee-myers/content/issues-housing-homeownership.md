## Utah Housing & Homeownership

Housing affordability is one of the most pressing issues facing our state.

Inventory is tight. Prices are high. First-time buyers are getting squeezed out. When housing costs rise faster than wages, it doesn’t just hurt buyers—it strains our entire workforce.

I have spent decades in real estate, not studying the housing market but living it. I understand the complicated dynamics behind housing shortages, interest rates, regulation, and supply constraints.

There are forces outside a state’s control—including federal monetary policy—but Utah still has meaningful tools. We can reduce barriers, encourage smart growth, and protect property rights while expanding opportunity.

I will bring practical, market-informed solutions to the legislature. Utah deserves solutions grounded in reality, not slogans.
