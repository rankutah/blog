As a State Senator, protecting and preserving homeownership will be a core priority of my work

## Protecting Homeownership.

Homeownership is foundational to family stability, financial security, and a sense of belonging. Through my work in real estate, I’ve seen where Utah’s homeowner protections fall short—and why those gaps matter.

If elected, I will champion practical, experience-driven reforms and bring three long-standing concerns into public discussion and legislative debate, because homeownership matters.

## My Focus:
-  Utah’s Homestead Exemption currently protects only $42,000 of equity per individual homeowner—an amount that no longer reflects today’s home values or housing costs.
- Protecting Ownership: Examine how community property title options will help Utah families better protect their homes during unexpected life changes.
- Short Sale State Tax: Examine Utah’s State tax treatment of short sales, including whether homeowners should be exempt from state income tax on mortgage debt forgiven through a short sale.

These differences aren’t obvious to most homeowners. In fact, many people don’t realize the limits of Utah’s laws until they need protection. My approach will be grounded in real-world experience, careful research, and a commitment to strengthening Utah families and the housing community.
