## Education

## I believe in public education — and I trust Alpine School District

I am not in favor of using public property tax dollars to fund private schools. This may be hard to swallow, but hear me out. Historically, public education is a shared investment in our communities, our workforce, and our democracy. Alpine School District covers all of my Senate District, and they deserve strong, consistent support.

I have seen the studies on what happens when tax dollars are funneled to private schools. Public schools serve all children, regardless of background or belief, and I want my position to reflect that commitment clearly and transparently. I welcome the debate and promise to keep an open mind to alternative options.

## Education is personal to me.

Teachers shape lives. They deserve respect, support, and fair compensation.

Smart funding: Support teachers without hurting students.

- Examine how property taxes are currently allocated to the Alpine School District.
- Ask hard, practical questions about how we can increase teacher pay responsibly.
- Look for solutions that strengthen classrooms without increasing financial pressure on families or reducing student resources.

This is not about slogans — it’s about careful analysis, collaboration, and accountability.

## Focused learning matters — kids need childhood.

I believe it’s time to re-evaluate how much technology we place in front of children during the school day.

I have studied the growing body of research that shows that:

- Excessive screen use can interfere with brain development
- Constant digital stimulation affects emotional regulation
- Social media and device dependence reduce real-world social skills and resilience
- Increase recess — outdoor play and less supervised social settings

Technology has a place — but it should support learning, not replace it.

## Books over screens. Learning over distraction.

I support learning environments that prioritize attention, comprehension, and human connection.

### Public schools should be phone-free learning spaces.

No phones during the school day — not because we don’t trust students, but because their developing brains deserve protection.

Children need time to:

- Learn how to focus
- Learn how to interact face-to-face
- Learn how to play, create, and problem-solve together

## Our children deserve our full attention.

Education is not just about test scores — it’s about healthy development, curiosity, confidence, and connection.

I will always approach education policy with:

- Respect for teachers
- Trust in public schools
- Curiosity guided by research
- A commitment to what helps children truly thrive

Strong public schools build strong communities. That’s a value I’ll carry with me to the Utah State Senate.
