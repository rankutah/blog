# Education

Utah believes in investing in people. Our economic future depends on thriving public schools and policies that support the well-being of teachers, students, and the working families that schools aim to serve.

## Public Schools First

Education is personal to me.

In my twenties, I was admitted to the College of Education at the University of Arizona, majoring in mathematics with a minor in Deaf Studies. My dream was to become a high school math and American Sign Language teacher.

That early path shaped how I view public education—not as a policy debate, but as a calling. Public school teachers shape lives every day. They deserve respect, meaningful support, and compensation that reflects the time, skill, and dedication they give to Utah’s children.

I believe property tax dollars should prioritize public schools. Alpine School District deserves steady, reliable support from both elected leaders and the communities it serves. Public schools welcome every child—regardless of background, belief, or ability. That commitment matters deeply to me.

I will examine how property taxes are allocated, ask practical, data-driven questions, and pursue solutions grounded in collaboration. This is not about slogans—it is about getting the details right while welcoming thoughtful debate.
