# Education

Utah believes in investing in people. Our economic future depends on thriving public schools and policies that support the well-being of teachers, students, and the working families that schools aim to serve.

## Early Child Care

I want Utah to seriously explore state-supported childcare beginning at age three — responsibly, fiscally, and thoughtfully. When parents can work, small businesses grow, tax revenue increases, and children benefit from early learning environments.

This is not about expanding government. It is about strengthening families. When childcare is available, parents will work, businesses will hire, and our economy will grow. Growth strengthens our tax base. This is how we can support families and address Utah housing without sacrificing fiscal discipline.

As of 2026, twelve states offer some form of state-supported early childcare. In 2025, New Mexico became the first in the nation to guarantee universal, no-cost childcare for all families.

Utah should not sit on the sidelines. Utah has the fiscal strength and innovative spirit to explore what’s possible. Let’s examine the data, learn from those leading the way, and determine whether we can responsibly become the next state to lead.

## I believe in public education — and I trust Alpine School District

I am not in favor of using public property tax dollars to fund private schools. This may be hard to swallow, but hear me out. Historically, public education is a shared investment in our communities, our workforce, and our democracy. Alpine School District covers all of my Senate District, and they deserve strong, consistent support.

I have seen the studies on what happens when tax dollars are funneled to private schools. Public schools serve all children, regardless of background or belief, and I want my position to reflect that commitment clearly and transparently. I welcome the debate and promise to keep an open mind to alternative options.

## Education is personal to me.

Teachers shape lives. They deserve respect, support, and fair compensation.

Smart funding: Support teachers without hurting students.

- Examine how property taxes are currently allocated to the Alpine School District.
- Ask hard, practical questions about how we can increase teacher pay responsibly.
- Look for solutions that strengthen classrooms without increasing financial pressure on families or reducing student resources.

This is not about slogans — it’s about careful analysis, collaboration, and accountability.

## Focused learning matters — kids need childhood.

I believe it’s time to re-evaluate how much technology we place in front of children during the school day.

I have studied the growing body of research that shows that:

- Excessive screen use can interfere with brain development
- Constant digital stimulation affects emotional regulation
- Social media and device dependence reduce real-world social skills and resilience
- Increase recess — outdoor play and less supervised social settings

Technology has a place — but it should support learning, not replace it.

## Books over screens. Learning over distraction.

I support learning environments that prioritize attention, comprehension, and human connection.

### Public schools should be phone-free learning spaces.

No phones during the school day — not because we don’t trust students, but because their developing brains deserve protection.

Children need time to:

- Learn how to focus
- Learn how to interact face-to-face
- Learn how to play, create, and problem-solve together

## Our children deserve our full attention.

Education is not just about test scores — it’s about healthy development, curiosity, confidence, and connection.

I will always approach education policy with:

- Respect for teachers
- Trust in public schools
- Curiosity guided by research
- A commitment to what helps children truly thrive

Strong public schools build strong communities. That’s a value I’ll carry with me to the Utah State Senate.
