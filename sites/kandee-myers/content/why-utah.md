## Why I Am Running

I’m running because I love this state deeply — its people, its history, and its promise.

I believe in the people of Utah — their goodness, resilience, and ability to come together when it matters. Utah knows how to start over, build community, and care for neighbors. As Abraham Lincoln said, “When I do good, I feel good. When I do bad, I feel bad.” That simple truth is lived and practiced here.

> “When I do good, I feel good. When I do bad, I feel bad.”

That simple truth lives in the hearts of Utahns. That’s why I’m excited for Utah. I believe we work better together, thrive when united, and I am ready to help move Utah forward toward something good — for everyone.

### I Love Utah

I love Utah because it is home to my Mother’s roots and to my hopes for the future. My ancestors immigrated from Denmark in 1847 and settled in Sanpete County, long before Utah became a state. That pioneer spirit still inspires me today.

From mountain peaks and world-class skiing to red rock canyons nestled in warm southern deserts, alpine lakes including our beloved Great Salt Lake, Utah’s landscapes are unmatched.
We are proud stewards of five national parks and more than 40 state parks, offering an extraordinary range of beauty reflecting both natural richness and resilience. I’m running because I love this state deeply — its people, its history, and its promise.

### I Believe in Utah

As Abraham Lincoln said, “When I do good, I feel good. When I do bad, I feel bad.” That simple truth is lived and practiced here.

### I Know Utah

Long before statehood, Utah was strengthening local economies and practicing self-governance. In 1891, local leaders organized communities so both political parties would be represented — not to control outcomes, but to foster civic maturity. That commitment to a two-party system earned Utah statehood in 1896. I know Utah is ready. Ready for leaders to put the people of Utah first. Ready for leaders to be guided by principle, not party. Ready for respectful debate and balanced representation.

### I Trust Utah

Progress matters to Utah. From its earliest settlements, Utah invested in learning—not just in schools, but in people. Early leader Brigham Young emphasized education be rooted in critical thinking and practical application. That spirit still lives here. Education in Utah isn’t limited to classrooms. It’s about curiosity, exploring what’s possible, and carefully discerning what is true and useful. I trust Utah is ready to lead in innovation and problem-solving by working together with care and a shared purpose grounded in the common good.
