### I Love Utah {#i-love-utah .scroll-mt-24}

My roots run deep in Utah. My family came from Denmark in 1847 and settled in Sanpete County. That pioneer courage-faith, sacrifice, hard work-still shapes how I see this state and my responsibility living here.

Utah's beauty is undeniable-from mountain peaks to red rock canyons, from our five national parks to the Great Salt Lake. But what makes Utah extraordinary isn't just the landscape - it's the people who build lives here.

I love Utah-its people, its history, and its promised

### I Know Utah {#i-know-utah .scroll-mt-24}

Long before statehood, Utah was strengthening local economies and practicing self-governance.

In 1891, local leaders organized communities so both political parties would be represented — not to control outcomes — but to foster civic maturity. That commitment to a two-party system earned Utah statehood in 1896.

I know Utah is ready.

Ready for leaders to put the people of Utah first. Ready for leaders to be guided by principle, not party. Ready for respectful debate and balanced representation.

### I Trust Utah {#i-trust-utah .scroll-mt-24}

Progress matters to Utah.

From its earliest settlements, Utah invested in learning—not just in schools, but in people. Leader Brigham Young emphasized that education should be rooted in critical thinking and practical application. That spirit still lives here.

Education in Utah isn’t limited to classrooms. It’s about curiosity, exploring what’s possible, and carefully discerning what is true and useful.

I trust Utah is ready.

Ready to lead in innovation and problem-solving. Ready to work together with care and a shared purpose grounded in the common good.

### I Believe in Utah {#i-believe-in-utah .scroll-mt-24}

I believe in the people of Utah — their goodness, resilience, and ability to come together when it matters.

Utah knows how to start over, build community, and care for neighbors. As Abraham Lincoln said, “When I do good, I feel good. When I do bad, I feel bad.” That simple truth is lived and practiced here.

Utah’s beehive isn’t just a symbol—it’s a way of life. Bees work independently, yet every effort strengthens the whole.

I believe Utah is ready.

Ready to stand up and stand out. Ready to pull together and build a future that serves our entire Utah community.
