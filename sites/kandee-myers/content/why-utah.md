# Why I Am Running

I love Utah because it is home to my Mother’s roots and to my hopes for the future. My ancestors immigrated from Denmark in 1847 and settled in Sanpete County, long before Utah became a state. That pioneer spirit still inspires me today.

From mountain peaks and world-class skiing to red rock canyons nestled in warm southern deserts, alpine lakes including our beloved Great Salt Lake, Utah’s landscapes are unmatched. We are proud stewards of five national parks and more than 40 state parks, offering an extraordinary range of beauty reflecting both natural richness and resilience.

I’m running because I love this state deeply — its people, its history, and its promise.

I believe in the people of Utah — their goodness, their resilience, and their ability to come together when it matters. Utah knows what it means to start over, to build community, and to look out for one another. Utah’s history teaches compassion. It reminds us to welcome newcomers and care for our neighbors — not because it’s easy, but because people matter. As Abraham Lincoln said,

> “When I do good, I feel good. When I do bad, I feel bad.”

That simple truth lives in the hearts of Utahns. That’s why I’m excited for Utah. I believe we work better together, thrive when united, and I am ready to help move Utah forward toward something good — for everyone.
