# Child Care

Utah believes in investing in people. Our economic future depends on thriving public schools and policies that support the well-being of teachers, students, and the working families that schools aim to serve.

**I want Utah to seriously explore state-supported early childcare education** beginning at age three — responsibly, fiscally, and thoughtfully. When parents can work, small businesses grow, tax revenue increases, and children benefit from early learning environments.

This is not about expanding government. **It is about strengthening families.** When childcare is available, parents will work, businesses will hire, and our economy will grow. Growth strengthens our tax base. **This is how we can support families and address Utah housing without sacrificing fiscal discipline.**

As of 2026, twelve states offer some form of state-supported early childcare. In 2025, New Mexico became the first in the nation to guarantee universal, no-cost childcare for all families.

**Utah should not sit on the sidelines.** Utah has the fiscal strength and innovative spirit to explore what’s possible. Let’s examine the data, learn from those leading the way, and determine whether we can responsibly become the next state to lead. **Utah is ready to stand up and stand out.**
