# Term Limits

I support reasonable term limits because public service should remain rooted in accountability, fresh perspective, and connection to the people being served.

Thoughtful term limits help keep leadership responsive, prevent the concentration of power, and open the door to new voices and ideas — while still honoring experience and institutional knowledge.

Elected office is a responsibility, not an entitlement, and term limits help ensure public servants can do meaningful, focused work during their time in office.
