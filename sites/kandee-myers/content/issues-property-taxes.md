**Property taxes are an investment.**

Utah ranks near the bottom nationally in per-student school funding. For a state that values families and invests in the future, that reality deserves honest conversation. As a real estate professional, I have seen what happens when communities focus only on keeping taxes low without also investing wisely in schools and infrastructure.

Utah is fortunate. We have engaged parents, dedicated teachers, and communities willing to step in when funding falls short. But relying too heavily on personal sacrifice, I believe, asks too much of families.

I will use a careful, data-driven approach to evaluate how Utah County invests property tax dollars—from roads and parks to public safety and, especially, our schools. Utah’s “magic sauce” has always been strong parent involvement and volunteerism. That spirit is a strength — but we should also ask whether it is fair or sustainable.

Utah has learned to do a lot with less because our families and educators care deeply. The next step isn’t simply spending more — it’s investing smarter, so every child can thrive. I believe in accountability, smart spending, and long-term investment; however, strong communities don’t happen by accident. I trust Utah is ready to invest better.
