# Property Taxes

Property taxes support the services that make daily life work—our schools, roads, fire protection, police, and local government. These services matter deeply, and I believe they deserve careful stewardship and thoughtful investment.

At the same time, property taxes are often one of the most confusing and emotionally felt parts of local government. Homeowners experience them directly, yet many are unsure how rates are set, how dollars are allocated, or how rising home values affect long-term affordability.

## Our district

Utah State Senate District 21 spans communities along the east bench of northern Utah County, including Cedar Hills, Alpine, Highland, Pleasant Grove, American Fork, and portions of Lehi and Lindon. While each city has its own character, our communities share common priorities: strong schools, safe neighborhoods, access to homeownership, and a deep connection to where we live.

## Why it feels confusing

In Utah County, property taxes are local and layered. County and school taxes are shared, but each city sets its own rate based on its budget and services. That’s why homeowners in Cedar Hills and Highland can pay different property taxes—even with similar homes.

Understanding those differences is essential when working with the Utah State Legislature.

## My approach

As a State Senator, I am committed to approaching property taxes with curiosity, care, research-driven thinking, and respect for the people who pay them.

I will take a thoughtful, data-informed look at:

- How property taxes are assessed and adjusted over time
- How tax burdens differ across cities and neighborhoods within the same district
- Where property tax dollars are spent—and how clearly that information is communicated
- How rising home values affect fixed-income households and long-term homeowners

My goal is not to weaken essential services, but to ensure the system is transparent and aligned with today’s realities.

Good public policy asks careful questions:

- Are we funding what matters most?
- Are we balancing community needs with household affordability?
- Are there opportunities to improve clarity, equity, or efficiency?

I believe we can support strong schools, safe neighborhoods, and responsive local services while also protecting people’s ability to remain in the homes and communities they love.
