# Experience You Can Trust

I’ve worked in real estate for more than three decades—not as a theorist, but as someone who
has lived every side of the housing market.

I bought my first rental property in 1985. I’ve professionally sold real estate since 1994. In 2005,
my husband and I owned 20 properties. We were deeply invested—financially and personally—
in housing long before it became a headline.

Those closest to the market could feel the risk building.

Before the housing crash of 2007–2009, lending standards loosened, oversight weakened, and
complexity outpaced accountability. The result was devastating for families, communities, and
long-term economic stability.

## Helpful to understand what went wrong wasn’t malice—it was overconfidence.

- Deregulated financial markets
- Regulators who failed to enforce guardrails
- Financial institutions chasing short-term gains
- Rating agencies underestimating risk
- A culture that equated easy credit with prosperity

Housing prices don’t always rise. Markets don’t always self-correct.

## Why This Matters

Housing isn’t just an investment. It’s where families build stability, communities take root, and long-term wealth—or vulnerability—is created.

I’ve made smart decisions.
I’ve learned from hard ones.

Experience matters.

## My Commitment

As a Utah State Senator, I will approach housing policy with experience, humility, and long-term thinking—because I care deeply about homeownership and know Utah can do better.

“Housing crash of 2007-2009 wasn’t driven by malice—it was the belief that housing prices
would always rise, and that markets could self-correct without meaningful oversight”
