# Appointments & Repairs
{.center}

Appointments at BlueridgeTech are scheduled for device drop-off and initial evaluation. During your visit, we review the issue, collect details, and check the device in for service.

Repairs are not performed while you wait. After the evaluation, we follow up with findings, pricing, and recommended next steps before any repair work is completed.

This process helps ensure each device receives proper attention and an accurate diagnosis.
