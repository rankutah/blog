title: How to Prevent Google Analytics Script From Slowing Down Your Website and
  Ruining your Page Speed Performance Score

The Google Analytics script is heavy and will slow down your website. I have proven this form myself by going to Page Speed Insights and testing websites with and without the script. Many of the recommendations such as using the defer attribute are not reliable. Other recommendations like turning off enhanced measurement by toggling off outbound clicks, site search, video engagement, and file downloads, marginally help but do not solve the problem.

The script below solves the problem. It ensures the script is only loaded when the user interacts with the site by touching the screen (on a phone or tablet) or scrolls (on desktop). If none of this happens it waits 4 seconds and then fires.

You will miss capturing users in your Analytics who land on your site, do not interact in any way, and then drop. However, it is well worth the cost. My tests show this script to improve most websites by at least a half a second.

To use the script you simple replace the Google Analytics ID with your own script. Try it for yourself and notice the difference.

Enjoy the script!

```
<script>
(function() {
  const gtagId = 'G-REPLACE_ME'; // Google Analytics ID

  function loadGA() {
    if (window.gtagLoaded) return;      // only load once
    window.gtagLoaded = true;

    // Load GA library
    const script = document.createElement('script');
    script.async = true;
    script.src = `https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=${gtagId}`;
    document.head.appendChild(script);

    script.onload = () => {
      try {
        window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
        function gtag(){ dataLayer.push(arguments); }
        gtag('js', new Date());
        gtag('config', gtagId);
        gtag('event', 'page_view', { page_path: window.location.pathname });
      } catch (e) {
        console.error('Error initializing Google Analytics:', e);
      }
    };
  }

  // Defer until 4â€¯sec or first user interaction
  setTimeout(loadGA, 4000);
  document.addEventListener('scroll', loadGA, { once: true });
  document.addEventListener('mousemove', loadGA, { once: true });
  document.addEventListener('touchstart', loadGA, { once: true });
})();
</script> 
```
