## Quartz Worx Website — Countertops in Grand Junction, CO

As a freelance website designer, I built the Quartz Worx website to explain the different types of countertop options and help customers get in touch. The site is custom‑built, loads fast, is easy to use on phones, and keeps navigation simple.

"Best and quickest customer service I have ever experienced with any website design company I have worked with over many years. They got our business's email and website servers switched over in a matter of minutes from our old one, and the website up and running in a few hours. Benjamin always answers my phone calls and gives a fast response to my texts and emails, and has helped us with a few technical difficulties that were beyond our skill set. A breath of fresh air compared to the tech companies I've worked with before."
