## Custom Websites Built for Growth — Not Just Looks

A lot of small business websites look fine, but they don’t bring in many calls or messages. Clean, modern sites load fast, work great on phones, and make it obvious what to do next (call, text, or send a message). Monthly plans keep things simple and affordable.

If you want to show up in Google’s local results and on Maps, we include practical local SEO that aligns with how nearby customers search.

- Google Business Profile optimization (categories, services, descriptions, photos)

- Local keyword research and page alignment to match search intent
- Review strategy and simple ways to reply
- Clear tracking so you can see calls and clicks
- Month‑to‑month plans with a simple report

## Ready To Get Started

I love partnering with business owners and specialize in building fast custom websites that turn visits into calls, bookings, and messages. Personally, I enjoy running, audiobooks, and all things tech. After growing up in Santa Clara (near St. George) and living in Provo and Logan, I now live in Orem with my wife and three daughters. I graduated from Southern Virginia University in Business and completed my Master’s degree at the University of Utah in Software Development.
