## Custom Websites Built for Growth — Not Just Looks

Most small business sites don’t bring enough traffic or leads. I combine custom website design and local SEO so your pages are fast, mobile‑friendly, and structured to convert visitors into calls and bookings. My monthly pricing keeps it affordable.

### On‑page SEO
- Find the exact phrases people in Utah search for — see my [On‑page SEO guide](/blog/on-page-seo-strategy-utah/)
- Write clear page titles and headings that match what people search
- Keep page addresses simple and readable (like "/services/roof-repair")
- Use good‑looking images that still load quickly, with helpful image descriptions
- Make pages load fast and feel smooth on phones and computers — see [Mobile Website Design](/blog/mobile-website-design-utah/)
- Connect related pages with helpful links and include the extra details search engines look for (business info, FAQs)

### Off‑page SEO
- Google Business Profile optimization (categories, services, photos)
- Apple Maps and Bing Places setup
- Keep business info consistent across 100+ directories, maps, and apps (citation management)
- Review strategy and response guidance
- Tracking and monthly reporting so you can see calls and clicks
- Guidance on local backlinks and visibility

Learn more about my process on the [Local SEO](/services/local-seo) page.

### What you get

- Custom website builds with clean modern design that looks great on phones.
- Basic local search setup (titles, fast load, Google Business Profile best practices) so you’re easier to find across Utah and Utah County.
- High‑converting small business sites with clear, persistent call and text buttons.
- Month‑to‑month support—no lock‑in—so your site keeps improving as your business grows.
- Simple monthly website plans instead of a big upfront fee.

{.w-40 .mb-4}
I enjoy running, audiobooks, and all things tech. After growing up in St. George and living in various parts of the state, I now live in Orem with my wife and three daughters. I graduated from Southern Virginia University in Business and I did my masters at the University of Utah in Software Development. I love partnering with business owners and building fast custom websites that turn visits into calls, bookings, and messages.
