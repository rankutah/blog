## Custom Websites Built for Growth — Not Just Looks

Most small business sites don’t bring enough traffic or leads. I combine custom website design and local SEO so your pages are fast, mobile‑friendly, and structured to convert visitors into calls and bookings. My monthly pricing keeps it affordable.

### On‑page SEO
- On‑page SEO optimization: titles, headings, internal links, and structured data designed around how people search for your services in Utah and Utah County.
- Clean, fast pages that load quickly and are easy to crawl.

### Off‑page SEO
- Google Business Profile optimization (categories, services, photos)
- Apple Maps and Bing Places setup
- Keep business info consistent across 100+ directories, maps, and apps (citation management)
- Review strategy and response guidance
- Tracking and monthly reporting so you can see calls and clicks
- Guidance on local backlinks and visibility

Learn more about my process on the [Local SEO](/services/local-seo) page.

### What you get

- Custom website builds with clean modern design that looks great on phones.
- Basic local search setup (titles, fast load, Google Business Profile best practices) so you’re easier to find across Utah and Utah County.
- High‑converting small business sites with clear, persistent call and text buttons.
- Month‑to‑month support—no lock‑in—so your site keeps improving as your business grows.
- Simple monthly website plans instead of a big upfront fee.

### Ready to Get Started
I enjoy running, audiobooks, and all things tech. After growing up in St. George and living in various parts of the state, I now live in Orem with my wife and three daughters. I graduated from Southern Virginia University in Business and I did my masters at the University of Utah in Software Development. I love partnering with business owners and building fast custom websites that turn visits into calls, bookings, and messages.
