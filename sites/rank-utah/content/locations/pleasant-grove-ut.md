## Website Design & Local Marketing Reviews from Small Businesses

{{< elfsight id="34cbde4c-9d31-432c-8bcb-9e123ab873fa" >}}

## Custom Websites Built for Growth — Not Just Looks

A lot of small business websites look fine, but they don’t bring in many calls or messages. Clean, modern sites load fast, work great on phones, and make it obvious what to do next (call, text, or send a message). Monthly plans keep things simple and affordable.

### Website redesigns (when your current site isn’t working)

If your site is outdated, slow, hard to use on mobile, or you’re not getting calls and messages from it, a website redesign can be one of the fastest ways to improve results.

What a redesign includes:

- Rebuild using your existing content as a starting point
- Improve mobile usability and page speed
- Refresh the design so it looks modern and trustworthy
- Ongoing support so the site doesn’t fall behind again

## What’s included

{{< cols min="18rem" gap="2rem" v="start" >}}

{{< col card="false" bg="gray-100" darkbg="gray-800" y="start" >}}

### Website Design

- Custom design and build (no templates)
- Mobile‑friendly and accessible layout
- Fast load times with optimized images
- Secure hosting with an encrypted connection (HTTPS)
- Automatic backups with every change

- Site‑wide search for easy navigation
- Ongoing support via phone, text, or email
- Monthly report on calls, messages, and site activity


{{< /col >}}

{{< col card="false" bg="blue-100" darkbg="gray-800" y="start" >}}

If you want to show up when people search online and on maps, local marketing includes the ongoing work that supports it.

- Google Business Profile improvements (categories, services, photos)
- Apple Maps and Bing Places setup and cleanup
- Business info kept consistent across major directories (100+)
- Figure out what people search for and update your profile/pages to match
- Ongoing support via phone, text, or email

## Ready To Get Started

I love partnering with business owners and specialize in building fast custom websites that turn visits into calls, bookings, and messages. Personally, I enjoy running, audiobooks, and all things tech. After growing up in Santa Clara (next to St. George) and living in Provo and Logan, I now live in Orem with my wife and three daughters. I graduated from Southern Virginia University in Business and completed my Master’s degree at the University of Utah in Software Development.

## FAQ

{{< faqs >}}

### What is your experience?
I built my first professional small‑business website in 2023 after completing my Master’s in Software Development. Unlike many web designers who use template builders, I custom‑code sites for speed and performance. Every change is versioned, so it’s easy to roll back or restore a previous version if needed. With degrees in both Business and Software Development (and a background in cybersecurity), you get someone who understands the technical details and the business goals. You can see more on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-awerkamp/details/experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a> or the <a href="/about">About page</a>.

### How long does a custom site take?
Sites can be done in 3–4 weeks with good coordination.

### Are content updates really unlimited?
Yes. You can request changes or updates to your website at any time in the way that works best for you (call, text, or email).

### Do you handle hosting and the domain name?
Yes. Managed hosting and your domain name are included.

### Do I own the website?
Yes. You own the site from day one. If services are canceled, help is provided to transfer the site to a new developer.

### Are there upfront fees?
No. Pricing is a flat monthly cost that includes hosting, your domain renewal, updates, and support.

### Can I change plans later?
Yes. Plans can be changed at any time. The next invoice adjusts and services continue without interruption.

### What happens if I cancel?
No further charges after cancellation. The site stays online through the current billing period. On request, a content export is provided and the domain can be transferred.

### Do I need a long‑term contract?
No. Plans are month‑to‑month.

### What does Local Marketing mean?
Local marketing is the work that helps nearby customers find and choose your business. It includes keyword research/content alignment, Google Business Profile work, Apple Maps/Bing, 100+ listings, and reporting.

### What results should I expect from Local Marketing?
Local marketing is one of the most effective long‑term ways for a local business to get steady calls and messages because each improvement keeps working month after month.

Social media posts and ads can help, but they stop the moment you stop posting or paying. Local marketing build a strong foundation so you show up when nearby customers search.

Results depend on what you have to offer, the level of search interest in your area, and your competition.
