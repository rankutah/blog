## Serving Pleasant Grove, UT

My name is Benjamin Awerkamp and my passion is helping small businesses grow. My wife graduated from Pleasant Grove High School as a Viking, so it's been fun having an office in her hometown and helping businesses in this area.

### Website Design

My web design process is different from other website designers in that I always maintain my focus on marketing and the actual performance of the site. My websites are custom built so they are fast, beautiful, mobile-friendly, and you enjoy long-term support in the way that best fits your needs (calls, texts, emails, or meetings). Instead of large upfront fees I do a low monthly subscription with no lock-in contract so your website evolves with your business and allows you to focus on what you do best.

### Local SEO

My local SEO process is different from other marketing companies in that it is affordable, has no lock-in contracts, and you receive clear monthly reports so you are always up-to-date on how the SEO efforts are improving your business. I have an open communication policy so you can contact me any time. My method is low-risk, allowing you to come and see for yourself.
