# Local SEO Strategy for Small Businesses in Utah

_Utah office: [Pleasant Grove, UT](/locations/pleasant-grove-ut) — serving businesses across the U.S._

Local SEO helps a business show up when people search for services nearby (especially in Google Search and Google Maps). A good strategy has two parts:

- **On-page SEO**: what you do on your website.
- **Off-page SEO**: signals outside your website (Google Business Profile, reviews, citations, and links).

Below is a simple approach you can use for your small business in Utah.

## On-Page SEO

On-page SEO is about making sure your website is easy to understand (for customers and search engines), fast, and mobile-friendly.

### 1) Start with search intent + keyword targets

Keyword research is one of the most important parts of on-page SEO.

It’s how you align each page of your website with what real people are searching for. If a page doesn’t match the words and intent customers use in Google, it won’t rank — even if the page is beautiful and fast.

Pick one primary topic per page.

- Home page: what you do + where you do it.
- Service pages: one core service per page.
- Location pages (if you have them): one location per page.

When you choose keywords, focus on what customers actually type and include your service area:

- Service + city (example: “roof repair Provo”)
- Service + county (example: “website design Utah County”)
- Service + near me (your Google Business Profile helps a lot here)

**A strong option: Google Keyword Planner (inside Google Ads)**

Google Ads has a keyword tool that’s hard to beat for local keyword discovery:

- In Google Ads, go to **Tools** → **Planning** → **Keyword Planner**.
- Use **Discover new keywords**.
- Set the location to your service area (for example: Utah County, Salt Lake County, or specific cities).
- Review keyword ideas and the search volume for that exact area.

This is one of the best ways to discover what people are searching for in your local market so you can build pages that match demand.

**Other keyword research options**

- **Google Autocomplete**: start typing a service + city and note the suggestions.
- **Paid tools**: If you have the budget for it and are willing to learn new tools, Semrush and Ahrefs are considered the best paid keyword research tools.

**Google Search Console (find keywords you already rank for)**

If your site is verified in Google Search Console, it’s one of the best ways to find keywords you’re *already showing up for*.

- Go to **Search Console** → **Performance** → **Search results**.
- Look at **Queries** (the exact searches people used) and **Pages** (which page showed).
- Filter by **country** (United States) and, if helpful, compare **mobile vs. desktop**.
- Find opportunities like:
  - Queries with high impressions and an average position around **8–20** (close to page 1).
  - Queries where you’re getting impressions but a low click-through rate (CTR).
  - A page that ranks for several related queries but doesn’t fully answer them.

Then expand the page that’s already ranking:

- Add missing sections that answer those queries directly.
- Add local proof (photos, reviews, process, service area details).
- Improve headings so the page is easier to scan.
- Add a short FAQ for common questions.

This “upgrade what already works” approach is often faster than publishing a brand new page.

**Make it local on purpose**

Once you pick a keyword theme for a page, make the content local in natural ways:

- Mention the cities/counties you actually serve (only where it fits).
- Add local proof: photos, projects, reviews, and before/after examples.
- Answer local questions (pricing ranges, timelines, permits, seasons, etc. — whatever fits your business).

### 2) Use clear page titles, headings, and URLs

These are some of the strongest “what is this page about?” signals.

- **Title tag**: include the service + a city/state (or a very specific niche topic) when it makes sense.
  - If you leave the location out, you’re often competing nationally, which is much harder for a local business.
  - Adding the city, county, or state helps tie the page to the local area you actually serve.
  - It’s fine if your title is longer than ~60 characters. That “limit” is more about what typically shows in results, not a rule.
  - The title tag and meta description are usually what people see in Google search results, so write them for humans (clear, specific, and click-worthy).
- **H1**: should match the main promise of the page.
- **H2/H3 headings**: organize the page into scannable sections.
- **URL slug**: short and readable (avoid stuffing).

### 3) Write for humans first (then tidy for SEO)

The best-performing local pages usually do three things:

- Answer common questions quickly.
- Show real proof (photos, reviews, examples, process).
- Make it easy to contact you.

**Avoid thin content (and consolidate when pages overlap)**

One strong, useful page usually beats several thin pages targeting slightly different keywords.

If multiple pages (or old blog posts) cover the same topic, combine them into one deeper page:

- Merge the best parts into a single page that fully answers the search intent.
- Keep one URL as the “main” page.
- Redirect the old URLs to the main page so you don’t lose existing signals.

Google generally favors pages that are clear, helpful, and comprehensive for the query. Aim to make each page the best answer someone could find.

### 4) Mobile friendliness (Google cares)

Most local searches happen on a phone. If a site is hard to use on mobile, people bounce — and that usually hurts performance over time.

Google also evaluates your website from a mobile perspective. If the mobile version is slow, hard to use, or broken, it’s common to see rankings and conversions drop.

A mobile-friendly website typically has:

- Responsive layout (content stacks and resizes cleanly)
- Readable text without zooming
- Tap-friendly buttons and links
- Navigation that works with one thumb
- No popups that block the main content on mobile

### 5) Use PageSpeed Insights to find the biggest wins

Google’s free tool [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) is one of the fastest ways to spot problems.

What to look for:

- **Mobile score and “Core Web Vitals”**: focus on mobile first.
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: often fixed by optimizing the hero image and reducing render-blocking CSS.
- **Interaction to Next Paint (INP)**: often fixed by reducing heavy JavaScript.
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: often fixed by setting image/video dimensions and avoiding late-loading banners.

Common fixes that usually matter most:

- **Compress images** and serve modern formats (AVIF/WebP when possible)
- **Lazy-load** below-the-fold images
- **Limit scripts** (especially third-party scripts)
- **Cache static files** (a CDN helps)

### 6) Image basics that affect SEO

Images are one of the most common reasons a mobile page is slow.

**Lazy load below-the-fold images**

- Add `loading="lazy"` to images that aren’t part of the first screen.
- Set image dimensions (width/height or an aspect ratio) so the page doesn’t “jump” while images load (helps CLS).

**Compress before you upload**

- Quick option: compress JPG/PNG files with https://tinyjpg.com/ (or TinyPNG).
- If you upload lots of images, consider a repeatable workflow. You can also ask an AI tool to help you write a small script that fits your exact setup.

**Example: batch resize/compress on Mac or Linux (ImageMagick)**

This is a simplified version of the ImageMagick resize script idea: resize images to a max width, then reduce quality until each file is under a target size. It’s a good starting point you can customize.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -euo pipefail

folder_path="${1:-.}"
target_size=130000 # bytes (~130 KB)
max_width=1200

command -v magick >/dev/null 2>&1 || {
  echo "ImageMagick not found. Install it first (macOS: brew install imagemagick)." >&2
  exit 1
}

cd "$folder_path" || exit 1
mkdir -p Resized Originals
shopt -s nullglob

for input_image in *.jpg *.jpeg *.JPG *.JPEG *.png *.webp *.heic *.HEIC; do
  base="${input_image%.*}"
  output="Resized/${base}.jpg"

  # Linux vs macOS stat
  if stat --version >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    size=$(stat -c %s "$input_image")
  else
    size=$(stat -f %z "$input_image")
  fi

  quality=85
  while :; do
    magick "$input_image" -resize "${max_width}x" -quality "$quality" -sampling-factor 4:2:0 -strip "$output"

    if stat --version >/dev/null 2>&1; then
      new_size=$(stat -c %s "$output")
    else
      new_size=$(stat -f %z "$output")
    fi

    [ "$new_size" -le "$target_size" ] && break

    rm -f "$output"
    quality=$((quality - 10))
    [ "$quality" -le 30 ] && {
      magick "$input_image" -resize "${max_width}x" -quality 30 -sampling-factor 4:2:0 -strip "$output"
      break
    }
  done

  mv "$input_image" "Originals/"
done
```

To install ImageMagick on macOS: `brew install imagemagick`.

**Image basics that affect SEO (still worth doing)**

- Use descriptive file names when possible.
- Add helpful alt text (describe the image; don’t spam keywords).
- Keep images small enough to load quickly on mobile.

### 7) Third-party scripts: load less, and load later

Third-party scripts can slow a site down on mobile (analytics, chat widgets, heatmaps, embedded maps, schedulers, etc.).

When possible, delay loading scripts until someone interacts with the page (or after a short timeout). This approach often improves mobile performance and Core Web Vitals.

```html
<script>
(function () {
  function loadTrackingScripts() {
    if (window.trackingLoaded) return;
    window.trackingLoaded = true;

    // Example: insert your tracking script(s) here.
    // Create <script async src="..."></script> and append to <head>.
  }

  setTimeout(loadTrackingScripts, 4000);
  document.addEventListener('scroll', loadTrackingScripts, { once: true });
  document.addEventListener('mousemove', loadTrackingScripts, { once: true });
  document.addEventListener('touchstart', loadTrackingScripts, { once: true });
})();
</script>
```

Tip: This same pattern can be used for analytics, chat widgets, schedulers, and embedded map scripts.

### 8) Add basic schema markup

For local businesses, simple structured data can help search engines understand your business details.

Common schema types:

- Local business / professional service
- Service
- Reviews (only if they follow platform guidelines)

## Off-Page SEO

Off-page SEO is about building trust signals that Google can see. For local results, the biggest levers are usually:

- Google Business Profile
- Reviews
- Citations (business directory listings)
- Local links (backlinks)

### 1) Google Business Profile (GBP)

Your Google Business Profile is often the first thing customers see.

Focus on:

- **Primary category**: choose the closest match to your main service.
- **Services**: fill out the service list (don’t leave it empty).
- **Description**: clear, plain language about what you do and where.
- **Photos**: real photos build trust (office, team, work, before/after).
- **Q&A**: add a few common questions (and answer them).
- **Posts**: occasional updates can help engagement.
- **Website link**: send people to the most relevant page (often a service page, not always the homepage).

### 2) Reviews (quantity + quality + consistency)

Reviews matter because they influence clicks and calls.

A simple system:

- Ask after a job is finished.
- Make it easy (send the review link).
- Respond to reviews (short, professional replies are fine).

### 3) Citations (directory listings)

A citation is your business listed on other sites.

The most important rule is consistency:

- Name
- Address
- Phone number

Keep these consistent across platforms.

### 4) Link building (earn local authority)

Links are still one of the strongest “trust” signals. For local SEO, quality matters much more than volume.

Ideas that work for Utah small businesses:

- Chamber of Commerce listings
- Local sponsorships (events, teams, nonprofits)
- Vendor/partner pages (suppliers, associations)
- Local PR (announcing something genuinely newsworthy)
- Helpful resources people want to reference (guides, checklists, calculators)

Avoid “shortcut” link tactics. They can create short-term gains but long-term problems.

### 5) A simple way to think about local rankings

Local SEO often comes down to three ideas:

- **Relevance**: do your pages and your GBP match what someone searched?
- **Prominence**: do other trusted sources talk about you (reviews, links, mentions)?
- **Proximity**: how close is the searcher to your location?

You can’t control proximity, but you can improve relevance and prominence.
