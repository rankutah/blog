# Privacy Policy

Last updated: October 14, 2025

I am committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information I collect, how I use it, and the choices you have.

This Policy applies to my website(s), services, and communications associated with clearpresence.io (and any subdomains) and related properties.





## Information I Collect

- Contact information, such as your name, email address, phone number, company, and any message you submit via forms.
- Business information you share when requesting a quote or project (e.g., website URL, goals, service area).
- Usage data, such as pages visited, referring URLs, device and browser information, and general location derived from IP address.
- Cookies and similar technologies that help me operate the site, remember preferences, and measure performance.

I do not knowingly collect sensitive personal information unless you voluntarily provide it for a clear purpose (for example, to include in your website content).





## How I Use Information

I use information to:

- Respond to your inquiries and provide quotes or services you request.
- Operate, maintain, and improve the site and my services.
- Personalize content and communications.
- Analyze performance and usage to improve user experience.
- Protect against fraud, abuse, or security risks.
- Comply with legal obligations.





## Cookies and Analytics

I may use cookies and similar technologies to provide core functionality (e.g., session, preferences) and to measure performance. I also use analytics tools (such as Google Analytics and Google Search Console) to understand how visitors engage with my site. These tools use cookies or similar technologies to collect usage data.

You can manage cookies in your browser settings and opt out of Google Analytics by using the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.





## Legal Bases (EEA/UK Visitors)

If you are in the EEA or UK, my legal bases for processing include:

- Performance of a contract (e.g., providing services you request)
- Legitimate interests (e.g., site security, service improvement, marketing your inquiry)
- Consent (e.g., non-essential cookies, optional marketing communications)
- Legal obligations





## Sharing of Information

I do not sell your personal information. I may share information with:

- Service providers that help me operate the site or deliver services (for example, hosting, analytics, email delivery).
- Professional advisors (accountants, legal counsel) under confidentiality.
- Authorities, if required by law or to protect my rights or users.
- Successors in the event of a merger, acquisition, or reorganization.





## Data Retention

I retain information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described above or as required by law. When no longer needed, I take steps to delete, anonymize, or securely store it.





## Your Rights and Choices

Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, restrict, or object to certain processing of your personal information. You may also have rights to data portability and to withdraw consent.

To exercise your rights, contact me using the information below. I will respond as required by applicable law.





## Children’s Privacy

My services are not directed to children under 13, and I do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe I have collected personal information from a child, please contact me so I can take appropriate action.





## International Transfers

I may process and store information in the United States and other countries, which may have different data protection laws than your country of residence. When I transfer personal data, I implement appropriate safeguards as required by law.





## Changes to This Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. I will post the updated version and update the “Last updated” date above. Your continued use of the site after an update constitutes acceptance of the revised Policy.
