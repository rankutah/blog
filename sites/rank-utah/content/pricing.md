      - question: "Is SEO included in Website Design?"
        answer: "Yes. Website Design includes foundational technical SEO and on-page SEO so your site is search-ready (clean structure, titles/descriptions, headings, internal links, fast pages, and mobile-friendly layout). Local SEO is the monthly service for Google Business Profile work, Maps visibility, listings, and reporting."
