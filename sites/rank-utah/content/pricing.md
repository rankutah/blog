## Frequently asked questions

{{< faqs >}}

### What does Local SEO mean?
Local SEO (search engine optimization) means showing up online when people search for your services or products in your local area. You can learn more about local SEO by visiting the [Local SEO](/services/local-seo) page.

### Can I change plans later?
Yes. Plans can be changed at any time. The next invoice is adjusted accordingly and services continue without interruption.

### What happens if I cancel?
No further charges after cancellation. The site stays online through the current billing period. On request, a content export is provided and the domain can be pointed elsewhere.

### Do you charge setup fees?
No. Setup is included in your monthly price.

### What does “unlimited content updates” include?
No hard cap. Requests typical of a small‑business website are included. Make requests via email, text, or phone. Send images via email or uploading to your Google Drive folder. Blog posts you provide are published as well.

Included examples:
- Update text, photos, hours, services, menus, pricing, or FAQs
- Add pages like About, Services, Reviews, Gallery, Locations, or Contact
- Post articles/announcements you supply

Fair use and scope:
- Majorly customized or out‑of‑the‑ordinary work (e.g., complex tools, custom integrations, web apps, or bulk content migrations) is quoted separately
- Heavy request bursts may be queued to maintain quality

### Is Website Design included in the Local SEO plan?
No. Local SEO is a separate service. If you need both, choose the bundle to save $49/month.

### How long does a new site take?
Sites can be built in 2-3 weeks with your frequent coordination.
