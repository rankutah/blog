## Frequently asked questions

{{< faqs >}}

### What is Local SEO?

Local SEO stands for Local Search Engine Optimization. Local SEO is one of the most effective long‑term ways for a local business to get steady calls and messages because each improvement keeps working month after month (better profiles, better listings, better pages).

Unlike social media posts and ads, local SEO doesn't stop working when you stop posting or paying. Local SEO builds a strong foundation so you show up when nearby customers search.

Results depend on what you have to offer, the level of search interest in your area, and the level of competition.

### Do I own the website?
Yes, you own your website from day one. If services are canceled, help is provided to transfer the website and domain to a new developer.

### Can I change plans later?
Yes. Plans can be changed at any time. The next invoice is adjusted accordingly and services continue without interruption.

### What happens if I cancel?
No further charges after cancellation. The site stays online through the current billing period. Help is provided to transfer the website and domain to a new developer.

### Do you charge setup fees?
No. Setup is included in your monthly price.

### What does ongoing support include?
Requests typical of a small‑business website are included. Make requests via email, text, or phone. Send images via email or uploading to your Google Drive folder. Articles you provide can be published as site pages as well.

Included examples:
- Update text, photos, hours, services, menus, pricing, or FAQs
- Add pages like About, Services, Reviews, Gallery, Locations, or Contact
- Post articles/announcements you supply

Fair use and scope:
- Majorly customized or out‑of‑the‑ordinary work (e.g., complex tools, custom integrations, web apps, or bulk content migrations) is quoted separately
- Heavy request bursts may be queued to maintain quality

### What do you do each month for local SEO?

Monthly work includes actively managing your local visibility by monitoring your search performance, analyzing ranking trends, and making ongoing improvements to your website, Google Business Profile, Apple Maps, and Bing Places. These updates ensure your business stays aligned with what customers are searching for and reflect the latest changes in how your keywords are ranking. You’ll also receive a transparent monthly performance report so you can clearly see how your visibility, traffic, and leads are improving over time.

### How long does a new website take?
Websites can be built in 2–3 weeks with regular coordination.
