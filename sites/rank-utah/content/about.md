# About

## A pretty site alone won't bring customers

Many owners are surprised when a nice looking site brings few leads. Clear Presence builds custom websites that are easy to find and built to bring in calls and messages.

## Meet the founder

I enjoy running, audiobooks, and all things tech. After growing up in St. George and living in various parts of the state, I now live in Orem with my wife and three daughters. I graduated from Southern Virginia University in Business and I did my masters at the University of Utah in Software Development. I love partnering with business owners and building fast custom websites that turn visits into calls, bookings, and messages.

My mission is to bring you customers. I invest in improving web design and local search skills and tools. Communication is open—reach out anytime by text, phone, email, or meeting. Clients get simple monthly visitor reports and are never locked into a contract.
