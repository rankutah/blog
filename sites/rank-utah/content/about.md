# Your Website Design & Local SEO Company

Hi, I’m Benjamin.

Clear Presence provides website design and local SEO services for small businesses. The goal is simple: a fast, professional website that helps people find your business on Google and then call, text, or send a message.

You’ll work directly with me from planning to launch. Monthly service keeps things simple and covers your website, managed hosting, and updates.

Call or text anytime with questions: [(385) 323-8130](tel:+13853238130)

## Meet Your Web Designer

I love partnering with business owners and specialize in building fast custom websites that turn visits into calls, bookings, and messages. Personally, I enjoy running, audiobooks, and all things tech. I graduated from Southern Virginia University in Business and completed my Master’s degree in Software Development.
