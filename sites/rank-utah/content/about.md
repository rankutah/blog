# About

## A pretty site alone won't bring customers

Many owners are surprised when a nice looking site brings few leads. Clear Presence builds custom websites that are easy to find and built to bring in calls and messages.

## Meet the founder

My mission is to bring you customers. I invest in improving web design and local search skills and tools. Communication is open—reach out anytime by text, phone, email, or meeting. Clients get simple monthly visitor reports and are never locked into a contract. Have a question? Please [reach out](/contact).
