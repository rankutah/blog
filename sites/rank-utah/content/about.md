# Your Website Design & Local SEO Expert

Clear Presence provides website design and local SEO services for small businesses across the U.S., from an office in [Pleasant Grove, Utah](/locations/pleasant-grove-ut).

The goal is simple: a fast, professional website that encourages visitors to call, text, or send a message.

You’ll work directly with me from planning to launch. Monthly service keeps things simple and covers your website, managed hosting, and updates.

## Meet Your Web Designer

I specialize in building fast, custom‑coded websites that help turn visits into calls, texts, and bookings. Unlike many builders who rely on templates, I build for performance and clean code from the start. Every change is versioned, so it’s easy to restore a previous version if needed.

I also understand both sides of the work: I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Business and a Master’s degree in Software Development, and I’ve worked in cybersecurity at companies like Arctic Wolf and Okta.

Personally, I enjoy running, audiobooks, and all things tech.
