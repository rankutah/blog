## Small Agency vs. Big Agency

## Small Agency ✅

### 1. Personal Service & Better Results
Work directly with a dedicated expert who builds your site. This direct line means better collaboration, a clearer focus on your business goals, and a final product that brings in leads.

### 2. Custom-Built for Performance
Your site is built from the ground up to be fast, lightweight, and perfectly tailored to your needs. No bloated templates or unnecessary features that slow you down.

### 3. Dedicated Ongoing Support
Need an update? Call, text, or email for direct support. Get responsive, ongoing help from the person who knows your project inside and out.

### 4. Affordable Monthly Pricing
With no agency overhead, you get top-tier work without the shocking price tag. Simple, transparent monthly pricing with no long-term contracts.

## Agency ❌

### 1. Slow and Impersonal
You'll likely be passed between account managers and junior staff. Your message gets lost in translation, leading to a generic site that misses the mark.

### 2. Bloated Templates
Agencies often rely on cookie-cutter templates that are slow, hard to customize, and full of security holes.

### 3. Limited Support
Post-launch, you're often handed off to a support desk, facing slow response times and strict limits on what they'll update.

### 4. High Upfront & Hidden Fees
Agencies charge huge upfront fees to cover their overhead, then surprise you with extra costs for basic maintenance and updates.
