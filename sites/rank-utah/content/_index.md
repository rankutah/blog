{{< col card="true" bg="blue-100" darkbg="gray-800" y="start" >}}
## Clear Presence ✅

<br>

### 1. Focus on Results
Beautiful design with a strategic marketing focus. Pages are built with a marketing focus. Once your website is live, you will receive monthly analytic reports telling you how many visitors your site had, which pages they visited, how they found your website, and where they are located.

### 2. Custom Built
Websites automatically change between light and dark mode based on the viewers device preferences allowing you please everyone. Websites are completely custom built which means faster page loads without the bloat, cleaner design, and greater flexibility to grow with your business.

### 3. Long-Term Support
Receive updates as long as you remain a customer. Your webdsite evolves with your business and you can receive support in the way that best fits your needs (calls, email, texts, or meetings).

### 4. Low Monthly Costs
You get a high performance website without the high risk. There is no lock-in contract. The low monthly cost keeps Clear Presence countinuously committed to your needs.

## Other Companies ❌

<br>

### 1. Focus on Aesthetics
Other web design companies focus on aesthetics. If your site looks nice they have done their job. They take their high costs upfront and then leave or offer limited updates. Many businesses come away frustrated after realizing that their beautiful website will bring zero customers without marketing.

### 2. Built with Templates
No light and dark mode. Built with bloated templates that often load slowly, limit functionality, and limit design changes.

### 3. No Long-term Support
Websites are meant to evolve with your company but many website designers build your website and then turn it over to you. If they do over a maintence package they often limit edits and provide limited forms of communication.

### 4. High Upfront Costs
Most web designers require high costs upfront before they will build your website. If you don't like the level of service they provide or the website you are stuck.
