## Small Team vs. Big Agency

{{< col card="true" bg="gray-100" darkbg="gray-800" y="start" >}}
## Small Team ✅

### 1. Talk to the person building the site
Work directly with the person doing the work. That keeps communication simple and helps the website bring in more calls and messages.

### 2. Built to load fast
Pages are built to be quick and easy to use on phones and computers. No extra clutter that slows things down.

### 3. Dedicated Ongoing Support
Need an update? Call, text, or email for direct support. Get responsive, ongoing help from the person who knows your project inside and out.

### 4. Affordable Monthly Pricing
Skip big-agency overhead. Get clear monthly pricing with no long-term contract.

## Agency ❌

### 1. More people, more delays
Projects move between multiple people. That can slow things down and lead to a website that feels generic.

### 2. Bloated Templates
Agencies rely on cookie-cutter templates that are slow, hard to customize, and full of security holes.

### 3. Limited Support
Post-launch, you're handed off to a support desk, facing slow response times and strict limits on what they'll update.

### 4. High Upfront & Hidden Fees
Agencies charge huge upfront fees to cover their overhead, then surprise you with extra costs for basic maintenance and updates.
