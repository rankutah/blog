### One-on-one ✅

#### 1. Work directly with the builder
No handoffs. You talk to the person doing the work, so communication stays simple and the website stays aligned with what gets you leads.

#### 2. Built to be fast (with proof)
Custom-coded pages that stay lightweight — no extra clutter that slows things down.

Want to compare? [Take the Website Speed Challenge](/speed-challenge/).

#### 3. Clear monthly reporting (with evidence)
You get simple monthly reports so you can see calls, clicks, and what to improve next.

See an example: [Sample monthly report](/reports/sample-monthly-report/) (or [download the PDF](/reports/website-and-local-seo-analytics-report.pdf)).

#### 4. Simple pricing + ownership
Month‑to‑month plans with clear pricing. You own your website from day one without upfront risk.

### Agency ❌

#### 1. More people, more delays
Projects move between multiple people. That can slow things down and make communication harder.

#### 2. Bloated templates
Many agencies rely on cookie-cutter templates and heavy plugins that add bloat and slow down load times.

#### 3. Limited support
After launch, you’re often handed off to a support desk with slower response times and stricter limits on updates.

#### 4. High upfront + hidden fees
Higher overhead often means higher upfront costs, then extra fees for maintenance and changes.

## FAQs
{.center}

{{< faqs >}}

#### What is your experience?
I started building websites for small businesses in 2023 after completing my Master’s in Software Development. Unlike most web designers who use templates, I custom‑code websites for speed, [performance](/speed-challenge/), and flexibility. Every change I make is backed up, so it’s easy to restore a previous version if needed. With degrees in both Business and Software Development (and a background in cybersecurity), you get someone who understands the technical details and your business goals. You can see more on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-awerkamp/details/experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a> or the <a href="/about">About page</a>.

#### What is your web design process?
Learn more about the process for designing and building a custom website on the [Website Design](/services/website-design) page.

#### How do you compare to other website design companies?
Direct one-on-one communication and responsive support without big-agency overhead. No long-term contracts, hidden fees, or strict limits on edits.

#### Which locations do you serve?
Web design services are available to clients across the United States with an office in [Pleasant Grove](/locations/pleasant-grove-ut)
