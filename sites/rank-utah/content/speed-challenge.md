# Website Speed Challenge

If you care about speed and performance, here’s an easy way to compare this site with any other website.

## How to compare

1. Open <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Google PageSpeed Insights</a> (opens in a new tab).
2. Paste a URL you want to test and run the report.
3. Test a Clear Presence page (try the homepage or a service page) and compare.

A lot of websites are built on bloated templates or heavy plugins that slow things down. Clear Presence sites are custom‑coded to stay fast and lightweight.

## Quick links

- {{< button url="/" text="Home" >}}
- {{< button url="/services/website-design" text="Website Design" >}}
- {{< button url="/services/local-seo" text="Local SEO" >}}
