## 2. Eligibility and Accounts

You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) to use our Services. If you create an account or provide contact information, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information.

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.

## 7. Confidentiality

We will treat non-public information you provide in connection with the Services as confidential and will use it only to deliver the Services or as otherwise permitted by you.
