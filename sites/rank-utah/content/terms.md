## 2. Eligibility and Accounts

You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) to use the Services. If you create an account or provide contact information, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information.

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.





## 3. Acceptable Use

You agree not to misuse the Services or help anyone else do so. Prohibited behavior includes, without limitation:

- Interfering with or disrupting the operation of the Services.
- Attempting to gain unauthorized access to systems, data, or accounts.

- Infringing others’ intellectual property or privacy rights.





## 4. Intellectual Property

The Services, including content, design, and logos, are owned by Clear Presence or its licensors and are protected by applicable intellectual property laws. You may not use Clear Presence trademarks or content without prior written permission, except as allowed by law.

You retain ownership of content you provide; you grant a limited license to use such content solely to deliver the Services.





## 5. Quotes, Fees, and Payment

Quotes and proposals may include assumptions, scope, and timelines. Fees are due as stated in your agreement or invoice. Late payments may incur fees or service interruption. Taxes and third-party costs (e.g., hosting, domain registration, paid tools) may be billed separately.





## 6. Third-Party Services

The Services may link to or integrate with third-party services (e.g., hosting providers, analytics, email, payment processors). Clear Presence is not responsible for third-party services and disclaims liability arising from their use.





## 7. Confidentiality

Non-public information provided in connection with the Services will be treated as confidential and used only to deliver the Services or as otherwise permitted by you.

The Services are provided “as is” and “as available.” While efforts are made to keep the Services reliable and secure, no warranties are made, whether express, implied, or statutory (including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non‑infringement). The Services may not be uninterrupted, error‑free, secure, or meet every requirement.





## 9. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Clear Presence and its affiliates, contractors, and agents will not be liable for indirect or consequential damages arising out of or related to use of the Services. Total liability for any claim is limited to the amounts paid for the Services giving rise to the claim in the 12 months preceding the event.

You agree to use the Services responsibly and, where required by law, to indemnify Clear Presence from claims arising out of your misuse of the Services or violation of these Terms.





## 11. Termination

Access to the Services may be suspended or terminated if there is a material breach of these Terms, if required by law, or to protect the security and integrity of the Services. Upon termination, the right to use the Services ceases immediately.





## 12. Changes to the Terms

These Terms may be updated from time to time. The updated Terms will be posted with a revised “Last updated” date. Continued use of the Services after an update constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
