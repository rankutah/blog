# Terms of Service

Last updated: October 14, 2025

Welcome to Clear Presence. By accessing or using my website(s), products, and services (collectively, the “Services”), you agree to these Terms of Service (the “Terms”). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Services.





## 1. Who I Am

“Clear Presence” ("I," "me," or "my") provides web design, SEO, and related services. My primary website is clearpresence.io (including subdomains and related properties).





## 2. Eligibility and Accounts

You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) to use my Services. If you create an account or provide contact information, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information.

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.





## 3. Acceptable Use

You agree not to misuse the Services or help anyone else do so. Prohibited behavior includes, without limitation:

- Interfering with or disrupting the operation of the Services.
- Attempting to gain unauthorized access to systems, data, or accounts.
- Uploading malicious code or engaging in abusive or fraudulent activity.
- Infringing others’ intellectual property or privacy rights.





## 4. Intellectual Property

The Services, including content, design, and logos, are owned by Clear Presence or my licensors and are protected by applicable intellectual property laws. You may not use my trademarks or content without prior written permission, except as allowed by law.

You retain ownership of content you provide to me; you grant me a limited license to use such content solely to provide the Services to you.





## 5. Quotes, Fees, and Payment

Quotes and proposals may include assumptions, scope, and timelines. Fees are due as stated in your agreement or invoice. Late payments may incur fees or service interruption. Taxes and third-party costs (e.g., hosting, domain registration, paid tools) may be billed separately.





## 6. Third-Party Services

My Services may link to or integrate with third-party services (e.g., hosting providers, analytics, email, payment processors). I am not responsible for third-party services and disclaim all liability arising from their use.





## 7. Confidentiality

I will treat non-public information you provide in connection with the Services as confidential and will use it only to deliver the Services or as otherwise permitted by you.





## 8. Warranties and Disclaimers

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Services are provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

I do not warrant that the Services will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or meet your requirements.





## 9. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Clear Presence and any affiliates, contractors, or agents will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, arising out of or in connection with your use of the Services.

My total liability for any claim arising out of or relating to the Services is limited to the amounts you paid to me for the Services giving rise to the claim in the 12 months preceding the event.





## 10. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold Clear Presence harmless from any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to your use of the Services or your violation of these Terms or applicable law.





## 11. Termination

I may suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time for any reason, including for violation of these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Services will cease immediately.





## 12. Changes to the Terms

I may update these Terms from time to time. I will post the updated Terms and revise the “Last updated” date above. Your continued use of the Services after an update constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.





## 13. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Utah, without regard to conflict-of-law rules. Any disputes will be resolved in the state or federal courts located in Utah County, Utah.
