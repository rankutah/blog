## Am I a good fit for Google Ads?

Google Ads is a good fit if you:

- Want more leads now and are willing to pay for them
- Can invest in monthly ad spend (separate from the management fee)
- Are willing to give the ads time to perform
- Understand results aren’t guaranteed and performance can vary (especially early on)

**Important:** The $299/month is the management fee and does not include ad spend.

## Pricing and requirements

- Management fee: **$299/month**
- Ad spend: billed separately (you pay Google directly)
- The monthly management fee applies to ad spend up to **$2,000/month** (above that, management is **15% of ad spend**)

### Requirements to run Google Ads

- Must be on the **Business Website + Local SEO** plan
- Must be willing to budget **at least $750/month** in ad spend (recommended starting budget is **$1,500/month**)
- Must be willing to commit to **1 month** (recommended commitment is **2 months**)
- Must have a **promo video** and **photos**

## Requirement 1: Business Website + Local SEO plan

This requirement is about getting the fundamentals right so your ads can perform.

- **Keyword research is part of the campaign setup.** The Website + Local SEO plan includes ongoing keyword research and content alignment, which helps build a campaign around what people actually search.
- **Fast, custom pages help lower costs and improve conversions.** Your site (and landing pages) are built from scratch and optimized for speed. Faster pages and clearer messaging typically convert better, which reduces wasted ad spend.
- **Effective tracking requires site access and clean implementation.** Being on the Website + Local SEO plan ensures I can set up and maintain accurate tracking and landing-page improvements over time.

## Requirement 2: Minimum $750/month ad spend (recommended $1,500/month)

Google Ads improves as it collects data—especially conversion data.

A higher starting budget typically means:

- **More clicks sooner**, which means faster testing of keywords, ads, and landing pages
- **More conversion signals**, which helps the algorithm learn who converts and where to spend
- **Faster iteration**, because changes get enough traffic to measure

A $750/month budget can work, but it often means slower learning and a longer runway before trends are clear.

## Requirement 3: One‑month commitment (two months recommended)

During the first month, there is a lot of testing. A meaningful part of your early budget goes toward gathering data and learning what works (and what doesn’t).

That’s why **2 months is recommended**: month two is typically where results become more consistent because you’re building on what the account learned in month one.

After your chosen period, we evaluate results together:

- Review lead quality, cost per lead, and conversion rates
- Compare against your **break‑even point**
- Decide whether to continue, make adjustments, or end the campaign

Google Ads is a **high‑risk / high‑reward** channel. It’s possible to spend money without getting the results you want—especially early on—so expectations and evaluation criteria matter.

## Requirement 4: Promo video + photos (for Performance Max)

I typically use **Performance Max (PMax)** as part of the campaign setup. PMax helps gather more data without investing everything into highly competitive (and often expensive) Search campaigns.

It also takes better advantage of AI, remarketing, and a higher potential to scale ad spend if it works.

PMax relies heavily on creative assets—especially video—so a **promo video is required**, along with a set of solid photos.

## Conversion tracking and how we measure results

Tracking is what turns Google Ads from “guessing” into a measurable lead system.

Setup typically includes:

- **Conversion tracking** for key actions like form submissions and calls
- **Call tracking** (or an audit of existing call tracking)
- **Values assigned** to conversions (phone calls, form fills, quote requests) so the account can optimize toward what matters most

### Assigning values to conversions

We work with you to define realistic conversion values—for example:

- A phone call from a qualified lead
- A contact form submission
- A scheduled booking slot

When possible, we also use **micro‑conversions** (smaller signals) to help guide learning—like spending time on key-pages or starting a form fill

## What’s included

- Conversion tracking + call tracking setup
- Campaign build and setup
- Keyword setup and management
- Landing page optimization for ads
