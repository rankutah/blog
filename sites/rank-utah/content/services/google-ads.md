## Am I a good fit for Google Ads?

Google Ads is a good fit if you:

- Want more leads now and are willing to pay for them
- Can invest in monthly ad spend (separate from the management fee)
- Are willing to give the ads time to perform
- Understand results aren’t guaranteed and performance can vary (especially early on)

**Important:** The $299/month is the management fee and does not include ad spend.

## Pricing and requirements

- Management fee: **$299/month**
- Ad spend: billed separately (you pay Google directly)
- The monthly management fee applies to ad spend up to **$2,000/month** (above that, management is **15% of ad spend**)

### Requirements to run Google Ads

- Must be on the **Business Website + Local SEO** plan
- Must be willing to budget **at least $1,500/month** in ad spend
- Recommended minimum runway: **2 months** (so we can evaluate performance at the end of month 2)
- Must have a **promo video** and **photos**

{{< button url="/pricing" text="See Pricing" >}}

## Requirement 1: Business Website + Local SEO plan

This requirement is about getting the fundamentals right so your ads can perform.

- **Keyword research is part of the campaign setup.** The Website + Local SEO plan includes ongoing keyword research and content alignment, which helps build a campaign around what people actually search.
- **Fast, custom pages help lower costs and improve conversions.** Your site (and landing pages) are built from scratch and optimized for speed. Faster pages and clearer messaging typically convert better, which reduces wasted ad spend.
- **Effective tracking requires site access and clean implementation.** Being on the Website + Local SEO plan ensures I can set up and maintain accurate tracking and landing-page improvements over time.

## Requirement 2: Minimum $1,500/month ad spend

Google Ads improves as it collects data—especially conversion data.

A higher starting budget typically means:

- **More clicks sooner**, which means faster testing of keywords, ads, and landing pages
- **More conversion signals**, which helps the algorithm learn who converts and where to spend
- **Faster iteration**, because changes get enough traffic to measure

Smaller budgets can work, but they often mean slower learning and a longer runway before trends are clear.

## Requirement 3: Recommended minimum runway (2 months)

Google Ads takes time to learn. If you stop too early, you usually pay for the learning but don’t get the benefits.

Here’s how to think about a typical 2‑month ramp:

- **Month 1: Buy data + experiment.** This is where **Google’s AI** runs experiments across variations—different keywords/search terms, ad copy and assets, networks/placements, audiences, and landing-page options. Our job is to set up clean tracking, feed it strong creative, and make smart exclusions/adjustments so it learns what produces real leads (and stops spending on what doesn’t).
- **Month 2: Establish a baseline + push efficiency.** We tighten targeting, improve conversion rates, and start moving toward profitability.
- **End of month 2: Decision checkpoint.** We review whether the campaign is profitable. If it’s not profitable yet, we compare performance **from the start of month 2 to the end of month 2** (cost per lead, lead quality, conversion rate, and overall efficiency) and decide whether you want to keep going or stop.

Google Ads is a **high‑risk / high‑reward** channel. It’s possible to spend money without getting the results you want. Two months gives us a reasonable timeframe to assess performance.

## Requirement 4: Promo video + photos (for Performance Max)

I use **Performance Max (PMax)** as part of the campaign setup because it has several advantages over a Search‑only campaign:

- **Gather more data for less** by using multiple channels, not just search clicks
- **Google’s AI optimizes based on your landing page** (and other signals) to find the people most likely to convert
- **Remarketing is built in**, so you can stay in front of people who already visited your site
- **More platforms to find what works** (Search, YouTube, Display, Discover, Gmail, Maps)
- **Higher potential audience for scaling over time** once we find what converts
- **Faster learning** because it can test more combinations of headlines, descriptions, images, and video
- **Intent + audience coverage** (it can capture both active searchers and high‑intent “in‑market” prospects)

PMax relies heavily on creative assets—especially video—so a **promo video is required**, along with a set of solid photos.

## Conversion tracking and how we measure results

Tracking is what turns Google Ads from “guessing” into a measurable lead system.

Setup typically includes:

- **Conversion tracking** for key actions like form submissions and calls
- **Call tracking** (or an audit of existing call tracking)
- **Values assigned** to conversions (phone calls, form fills, quote requests) so the account can optimize toward what matters most

### Assigning values to conversions

I work with you to define realistic conversion values—for example:

- A phone call from a qualified lead
- A contact form submission
- A scheduled booking slot

When possible, we also use **micro‑conversions** (smaller signals) to help guide learning—like spending time on key-pages or starting a form fill

## What’s included

- Keyword research & strategy
- Campaign build & launch
- Ad copy and asset creation
- Conversion and call tracking
