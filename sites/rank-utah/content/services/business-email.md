## Who this is for

This is for small business owners who want professional email (like `you@your-company.com`) but don’t want to worry about setup, security, deliverability, or managing users.

Think of it as **Google Workspace + a personal IT support person** focused on your company email and collaboration tools.

## What you get (Google Workspace)

Every plan includes the core Google Workspace tools:

- **Custom business email**: `name@your-company.com`
- **Google Calendar** (shared calendars, scheduling, invites)
- **Video meetings** (Google Meet)
- **Google Drive** storage (files, folders, sharing)

## What I do for you (managed service)

I act as your personal IT support for email and Workspace administration, including:

- Google Workspace setup and ongoing administration
- Add/remove users, aliases, groups, and access changes
- Account recovery support and password reset help
- Drive sharing + permissions guidance (including shared folders and access reviews)
- Calendar setup (shared calendars, team visibility, booking flows)
- Security best practices (MFA guidance, suspicious login review, basic policy configuration)
- Email deliverability setup and maintenance (DNS records like SPF/DKIM/DMARC)
- Troubleshooting issues like missing emails, sending failures, device setup, and sync problems

If you’re switching from another provider, I can also help plan (and usually perform) a smooth migration.

## Common questions

{{< faqs openFirst="false" >}}

### Do you manage the domain and DNS too?
Yes. If you want, I can manage the DNS records needed for reliable email delivery and make sure everything stays working.

### Can you help me migrate from my current email provider?
Yes. Migration is common (and usually painless) when it’s planned correctly.

### Is my email secure?
Google Workspace is a very strong baseline, and I’ll help you implement practical security like MFA and good account hygiene. No system is perfect, but this is one of the best setups available for small businesses.

### What if I need help fast?
You can reach me by text, call, or email. Most Workspace issues can be fixed quickly.
