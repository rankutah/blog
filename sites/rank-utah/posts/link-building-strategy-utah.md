# Link Building Strategy in Utah

For small businesses in Utah, getting noticed online can be a challenge. As a freelance web designer, I help my clients not only with their website's design but also with their off-page SEO. A crucial part of that is link building. Quality backlinks are like votes of confidence for your website in the eyes of Google, and they are a powerful way to increase your authority and climb the search rankings. This post will explain how link building works and why it's a game-changer for local SEO.

## How Link Building in Utah Works for Small Businesses

Link building (aka backlink building) increases the authority of your web pages. In local SEO, Google uses authority, [relevance](https://blog.rankutah.com/utah-on-page-search-engine-optimization/), and proximity to determine which websites show up at the top of organic results. Google confirms that authority is page-based, not site-based. This means a backlink won't boost every page on your site, only the authority of the specific page linked to. However, you can use that page's increased authority to increase the authority of other pages through internal linking. White-hat link building tactics are tactics focused on getting links in a natural way (not paying for links irrelevant to your business or using link network schemes).

While the 18.5% slice in the chart below may not seem as significant as other factors, it’s the hardest slice of the pie to acquire, and it’s what will set you apart. Not only can you receive traffic from visitors clicking those links, but you also receive organic traffic when your page appears in search results.

## Why Local Links Matter for Utah Local SEO

## Additional Tips for Link Building Strategy in Utah

### Local Chamber of Commerce

One of the simplest methods for acquiring a backlink is to pay for a membership with your city Chamber of Commerce. This is a great link as it ties you to your local area, comes from a reputable source, can potentially drive traffic to your website, while also providing any of the additional benefits the chamber provides such as networking meetings.

### Sponsorships

Sponsoring local events often provides you with a link to your website and greater visibility within your community. You can find sponsorship opportunities by typing in Google "inurl:sponsors cityName". This will give results for businesses that have the word "sponsors" within their website url.

### Partnerships

Consider who would naturally make referrals to your business and ask them if they will link to your website in exchange for something you can offer. The places where you would get the traffic you want for your website are the most natural and beneficial places to get a backlink. Think about websites where your customers would be found and partner with those companies.
