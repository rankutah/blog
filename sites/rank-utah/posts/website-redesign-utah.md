Is your website holding your business back? As the owner of a website design & local SEO company in Utah, I see many small businesses with outdated, slow, or broken websites. A website redesign can be a powerful way to refresh your online presence, attract more customers, and improve your Google ranking. In this post, I'll walk you through my simple, three-step process for a website redesign that will get your business back on track.

## How Does a Website Redesign Work for Small Businesses?

1. We Replace Your Existing Site: I recreate your website quickly, using your current content as a base
2. Your Website is Modern, Fast, and Google-Ready: Your new site is mobile-friendly, loads fast, and shows up in search
3. You receive ongoing support: I maintain your site as your business grows — so it never falls behind again

## Common Website Problems I Help Fix

- Update an outdated website
- Fix a slow or broken website
- Make your website mobile-friendly
- Improve your Google ranking
- Help with your website when your designer disappears
- Get a new website without losing your domain
- Ongoing website updates & content changes
- Affordable monthly maintenance

## Why Businesses Trust Me

I work directly with business owners to create websites that actually work — not just look good. You won’t get passed off to a big agency or left in the dark. I make sure you keep full control of your domain, your content, and your site. Every website I build is designed to be fast, mobile-friendly, and easy to update as your business grows. And unlike one-time designers who disappear after launch, I stick around to keep your site evolving with you — so you never fall behind again.
