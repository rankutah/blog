As the owner of a website design & local SEO company, I'm dedicated to helping small businesses in Utah succeed online. While a great website is the foundation, what happens off your website is just as important. Off-page Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is how you build authority and drive traffic to your site. In this post, we'll explore the three pillars of effective off-page SEO and how they can bring long-term, organic growth to your business.

## Why Off-Page SEO Works for Small Businesses in Utah

1.  Evergreen Growth - your traffic climbs month after month, without the sudden drops that come with paid ads or social media posts

2.  Cost-effective - every optimization brings long-term ongoing results

3.  Saves Time - brings organic leads instead of having to spend lots of time running promotions and marketing campaigns


## The 3 Pillars of Effective Off Page Search Engine Optimization

Local SEO is different from broad SEO in that it focuses on three core areas: Relevance, Prominence, and Proximity. The chart below shows the factors that influence lead generation for local businesses.

Source: Percentages are based on the average percentages given by ChatGPT (o4-mini-high) and Gemini (2.5 Flash) after performing Deep Research. Their results differed by an average of 6 percentage points for each of the factors.

## 1\. Relevance

Relevance is how well your content aligns with what the user is searching for. When setting up your website and/or blog, we want each page to match search intent. We do this by researching the keywords your customers are using and aligning them with your offerings. For local SEO, we also use location-based modifiers targeting a specific city or region. This helps you rank higher in that area and shows customers that your content is relevant to their needs. The title tag and H1 tag are the clearest indicators to Google of what your webpage is about. Your other headings and content should support these tags and add depth. On your Google Business Profile, your relevance is determined primarily by your primary category (this is the most critical relevance signal). Other relevance factors include:

1.  Secondary categories

2.  Business name

3.  Services/products listed

4.  Your website content, which Google uses to assess Google Business Profile relevance


## 2\. Prominence

Prominence is the authority of your content. For websites and blogs, it’s heavily influenced by the quantity and quality of backlinks, citations, and social shares. Links act as popularity votes in the eyes of Google. While all quality (non-spammy) backlinks are helpful, local backlinks from businesses or people in your area are the most impactful. They tie your website/blog to your target location.Another factor that influences the prominence of your website/blog is technical SEO, which focuses on the structure and performance of your website/blog:

1.  Faster load times: Improves user experience and rankings

2.  Mobile-friendly design: Google prioritizes this

3.  Clear structure: Helps search engines crawl and index effectively


For your Google Business Profile, prominence is determined by how engaging your profile is to the public, the number of reviews you have, and your average rating. The top three Google Business Profile listings often appear above websites in local searches, making it a powerful tool.

## 3\. Proximity

Proximity refers to how close a potential customer is to your business. You’ll naturally rank higher in search results for users who are physically closer to your Utah location. However, high relevance and prominence can extend your reach.

## Summary

Relevance, prominence, and proximity are the three pillars of local SEO in Utah. Your website, blog, and Google Business Profile are the most powerful tools you have. When combined with analytics, you’ll know where to improve and grow.
