## What are 3 important considerations of a mobile-friendly design in Utah?

1.  Responsive layout

2.  Fast loading

3.  Easy navigation


## 1\. Responsive Layout

Your website should adapt fluidly to any screen size. This means that columns should stack and images and text should resize.

## 2\. Fast Loading

Websites need to be optimized for cell-phones that are not connected to wifi. Three is the most important things to consider for mobile website design are the optimization of your images, use of scripts, and caching.

### Images

Images should be compressed so that they load quickly. Clear Presence uses automated image optimization to ensure they load quickly.

### Scripts

Javascript files should be limited and loading should be delayed when possible. Clear Presence uses a delay strategy to maximize mobile performance.

### Caching

Caching makes it so your website doesn't have to be loaded from the server where it is hosted each time someone visits your site. Instead, it is loaded from a cache that is closer to your users. Clear Presence relies on Cloudflare, which uses edge caching, so content is loaded from the nearest edge server.

## 3\. Easy Navigation

It should be just as easy for users to navigate the desktop version of your website as it is for them to navigate the mobile version.

## Conclusion

A website that uses responsive layout, is fast loading, and is easy to navigate is the basis for mobile-friendly design. As more and more users browse the web on their phones this becomes increasingly important.
