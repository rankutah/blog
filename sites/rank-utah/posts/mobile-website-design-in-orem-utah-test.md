## 1\. Responsive Layout

Your website should adapt fluidly to any screen size. This means that columns should stack and images and text should resize.

## 2\. Fast Loading

Websites need to be optimized for cell-phones that are not connected to wifi. Three is the most important things to consider for mobile website design are the optimization of your images, use of scripts, and caching.

### Images

Images should be compressed so that they load quickly. Rank Utah uses a [script to resize your images](https://blog.rankutah.com/shell-script-to-resize-images-to-be-under-a-specific-file-size/) to ensure they load quickly.

### Scripts

Javascript files should be limited and loading should be delayed when possible. Rank Utah uses a [delay function for your scripts](https://blog.rankutah.com/how-to-prevent-google-analytics-script-from-slowing-down-your-website-and-ruining-your-page-speed-performance-score/) to maximize mobile performance.

### Caching

Caching makes it so your website doesn't have to be loaded from the server where it is hosted each time someone visits your site. Instead, it is loaded from a cache that is closer to your users. For [local SEO,](https://blog.rankutah.com/utah-local-search-engine-optimization-local-seo-for-small-businesses/) the website should be close to the city or region where the business is located. Rank Utah relies on Cloudflare, which uses edge caching, so content is loaded from the nearest edge server.
