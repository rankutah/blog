If you're a small business owner in Utah, you know how important it is to be visible to your local customers. As a freelance web designer, I specialize in helping small businesses like yours improve their online presence. A critical piece of that puzzle is on-page Search Engine Optimization (SEO). This post will walk you through the essential on-page SEO techniques that will help your website rank higher in search results and attract more customers.

## On-Page SEO Strategy for Small Businesses

If your website is not aligned with what your customers are searching for you won't even show up in the search results. The basis of keyword research is finding keywords with high search volume and low competition so you can rank high for those searches. Professional tools give you the best results and Clear Presence uses industry‑leading tools to give you the best results.

## Title Tag

The title tag is the most important signal you provide to Google on what your page is about. Use your keyword research to determine a title with keywords that have good volume and are easy to rank for. Do not worry too much about the length of the title. Conventional wisdom is to make your title tag under 60 characters but recent case studies show that longer titles do not hurt your results.

## Meta Description

The meta description is used to summarize your page and is where you speak directly to your audience. Do not worry about using keywords in this description as it does not affect your pages rankings. The only purpose of this description is to help people understand what your page is about and decide if they want to click. The meta description shows up in the search results under your title tag.

## URL Slugs

URL slugs should be simple and keyword-rich. One common practice is to use the same url as your title.

## Headings (H1-H3)

Your page should have one H1 that tells your visitors what the page is about. It should match or be closely related to your title tag. It is often the largest or first headline on your page.

Your H2 and H3 headlines are used to support your H1. While you only use one H1 per page, you can and should organize your content with multiple H2 and H3 tags.

Your H1 and H2 and H3 headings have a large impact on your SEO and you want to use keywords that support your title tag keywords. In your research you want to identify you main keyword and also a list of related supporting keywords to use in your headlines and text. Your keywords should be natural throughout the content.

## Image Optimization

The images for your Utah business should be compressed and optimally use modern formats like AVIF or WebP. Images are one of the largest determinants of your page loading speed. Every image on your page will be downloaded by the browser of the device visiting that page. Ideally you want your images to be less than 150 KB in size.

### Image Keywords

The Alt-text on your image is used for those who use screen readers to browse your website and is also used by search engines to understand your images. You use the alt-text to describe your images and can naturally include your keywords in this description.

## Page Speed

The three biggest culprits of slow page loading times are unoptimized images images, too many scripts (javascript or tracking tools), and no caching or slow hosting.

Many modern editors let you lazy-load your images. This means they don't load until they come into view. This can greatly improve how fast your pages load.

The same is true for scripts. Scripts can be edited to delay loading using defer. I've found that the most reliable method though is using a simple timeout function. Here is an example of one using a 4 second delay or user interaction to fire the script.

```
// Load both scripts after 4 seconds OR on user interaction
setTimeout(loadTrackingScripts, 4000);
document.addEventListener('scroll', loadTrackingScripts, { once: true });
document.addEventListener('mousemove', loadTrackingScripts, { once: true });
document.addEventListener('touchstart', loadTrackingScripts, { once: true });
```

Enter your page url into [Page Speed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev) to test it's page loading speed. In additional to page speed performance, this tool will also give you a score for the accessibility of your site, your use of best practices, and rate your SEO. Helpful tips will be below your scores.

## Linking

Write good link text (anchor text) which is the text part of the link you can see. This helps your users and Google understand what you're linking to. Link between your pages and link to relevant and helpful outside sources.

## Schema Markup

Schema markup are files written specifically written to tell search engines about the page. You might use it to include your business hours, name, address, service areas, reviews, and reviews. This schema is particularly useful for small businesses and allows you to show up in the rich snippet results on Google. There are tools that help you create this schema automatically and you can also you AI bots like chat GPT to help write this markup. This is saved on your page as a json script. Here is Google's documentation for [Local Business structured data.](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/local-business)

Once you have your schema markeup in place you can validate it at [schema.org](http://schema.org) by pasting in your webpage to ensure there are no errors.
