As a freelance web designer in Utah, I see many small businesses with outdated, slow, or broken websites. A website redesign can be a powerful way to refresh your online presence, attract more customers, and improve your Google ranking. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through my simple, three-step process for a website redesign that will get your business back on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-does-a-website-redesign-work-for-small-businesses"&gt;How Does a Website Redesign Work for Small Businesses?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We Replace Your Existing Site: I recreate your website quickly, using your current content as a base&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your Website is Modern, Fast, and Google-Ready: Your new site is mobile-friendly, loads fast, and shows up in search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You receive ongoing support: I maintain your site as your business grows — so it never falls behind again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="common-website-problems-i-help-fix"&gt;Common Website Problems I Help Fix&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update an outdated website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix a slow or broken website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make your website mobile-friendly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve your Google ranking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help with your website when your designer disappears&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a new website without losing your domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ongoing website updates &amp;amp; content changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Affordable monthly maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work directly with business owners to create websites that actually work — not just look good. You won’t get passed off to a big agency or left in the dark. I make sure you keep full control of your domain, your content, and your site. Every website I build is designed to be fast, mobile-friendly, and easy to update as your business grows. And unlike one-time designers who disappear after launch, I stick around to keep your site evolving with you — so you never fall behind again.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Does Google Analytics Slow Down Your Website?</title><link>https://clearpresence.io/blog/does-google-analytics-slow-down-website/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://clearpresence.io/blog/does-google-analytics-slow-down-website/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Google Analytics is heavy and will slow down your website. I have proven this for myself by going to Page Speed Insights and testing websites with and without analytics. Some sites recommend using the defer attribute on your script but that does not help. Other sites recommend turning off enhanced measurement by toggling off outbound clicks, site search, video engagement, and file downloads. This marginally helps but does not solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Mobile Website Design in Utah | Freelance Website Designer for Small Businesses</title><link>https://clearpresence.io/blog/mobile-website-design-utah/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://clearpresence.io/blog/mobile-website-design-utah/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s world, most of your customers will visit your website on a mobile device.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convert multiple image to JPEG or a different image format such as AVIF or WebP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set the width of your images&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resize images so that each on is under a specified size (default of 130 KB)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organize your original images into an Originals/ folder and resized images into a Resized/ folder&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>On-Page SEO Strategy in Utah | Freelance Website Designer for Small Businesses</title><link>https://clearpresence.io/blog/on-page-seo-strategy-utah/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://clearpresence.io/blog/on-page-seo-strategy-utah/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a small business owner in Utah, you know how important it is to be visible to your local customers.
