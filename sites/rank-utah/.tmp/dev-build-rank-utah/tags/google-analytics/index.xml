I have proven this for myself by going to Page Speed Insights and testing websites with and without analytics. Some sites recommend using the defer attribute on your script but that does not help. Other sites recommend turning off enhanced measurement by toggling off outbound clicks, site search, video engagement, and file downloads. This marginally helps but does not solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
