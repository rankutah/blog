I have proven this for myself by going to Page Speed Insights and testing websites with and without analytics. Some sites recommend using the defer attribute on your script but that does not help. Other sites recommend turning off enhanced measurement by toggling off outbound clicks, site search, video engagement, and file downloads. This marginally helps but does not solve the problem.\nThe free script below solves the problem. It works by delaying Google Analytics from loading until the user interacts with the site by touching the screen (on a phone or tablet) or scrolling (on desktop). If none of this happens it waits 4 seconds and then execute.\nThe one downside of this script is that you will not capture users data for users who land on your site and drop within 4 seconds without interacting in any way. This is a small cost when considering that page load speed is one of the biggest factors in causing users to drop off in the first place. My tests show this script to improve most websites load times by at least a half a second and I use if for all of my sites.\nTo use the script simply replace the Google Analytics ID with your own Google Analytics ID.

As a freelance web designer, I help my clients not only with their website’s design but also with their off-page SEO. A crucial part of that is link building. Quality backlinks are like votes of confidence for your website in the eyes of Google, and they are a powerful way to increase your authority and climb the search rankings. This post will explain how link building works and why it’s a game-changer for local SEO.\nHow Link Building in Utah Works for Small Businesses Link building (aka backlink building) increases the authority of your web pages. In local SEO, Google uses authority, relevance , and proximity to determine which websites show up at the top of organic results. Google confirms that authority is page-based, not site-based. This means a backlink won’t boost every page on your site, only the authority of the specific page linked to. However, you can use that page’s increased authority to increase the authority of other pages through internal linking. White-hat link building tactics are tactics focused on getting links in a natural way (not paying for links irrelevant to your business or using link network schemes).\nThe Importance of Backlinks for Utah Local SEO This chart shows the importance of backlinks for local SEO in generating leads for your business. Backlinks are the most difficult part of a SEO link building strategy and a great way to differentiate your business from competitors and get ahead in the rankings. While the 18.5% slice in the chart below may not seem as significant as other factors, it’s the hardest slice of the pie to acquire, and it’s what will set you apart. Not only can you receive traffic from visitors clicking those links, but you also receive organic traffic when your page appears in search results.\nSource: Percentages are based on the average percentages given by ChatGPT (o4-mini-high) and Gemini (2.5 Flash) after performing Deep Research. Their results differed by an average of 6 percentage points for each of the factors.\nWhy Local Links Matter for Utah Local SEO For local searches Google provides local results. Goole’s goal is to provide the most relevant results for your search. Links from local businesses and organizations within your community show your web page is an authority, for the keywords it covers, within your community.\nClear Presence Link Building Services Help Businesses Get Directory Listings (Citations) Rank Utah uses a simple white-hat strategy to help small businesses in Utah acquire links. First, we focus on helping you get citations (business directory listings). We sync your business info to 150+ platforms, directories, map apps, consumer apps and voice assistants via the five leading data aggregators (Localeze, DataAxle, YP Network, GPS Network, and Foursquare). These listings act as the foundation to to showing up in Google Search Results. Google requires a consistent NAP (name, address, and phone number) for your business across the web if you want to show up in search results. This service syncs these directories with your business and enables us to update all listings whenever your business information needs an update. In addition to a consistent NAP, many of these directories also provide links to your homepage, boosting your homepage authority and potentially bringing additional traffic.\nCreating High Quality Content to Build Links One of the most effective link building strategies is create content that people find useful and naturally want to to link to. This can be done by using SEO keyword research tools to determine what your customers are searching for and what keywords are easy to rank for. You can learn learn more about keyword research in the article On-Page SEO Strategy .

As a freelance web designer in Utah, I specialize in creating websites for small businesses that look great and function perfectly on any screen size. A mobile-friendly website is no longer a luxury—it’s a necessity. This post will cover the three most important aspects of mobile web design to ensure your customers have a great experience, whether they’re on a phone, tablet, or desktop.\n3 Important Considerations for Mobile-Friendly Design in Utah Responsive layout\nFast loading\nEasy navigation\n1. Responsive Layout Your website should adapt fluidly to any screen size. This means that columns should stack and images and text should resize.\n2. Fast Loading Websites need to be optimized for cell-phones that are not connected to wifi. Three is the most important things to consider for mobile website design are the optimization of your images, use of scripts, and caching.\nImages Images should be compressed so that they load quickly. Clear Presence uses automated image optimization to ensure they load quickly.\nScripts Javascript files should be limited and loading should be delayed when possible. Clear Presence uses a delay strategy to maximize mobile performance.\nCaching Caching makes it so your website doesn’t have to be loaded from the server where it is hosted each time someone visits your site. Instead, it is loaded from a cache that is closer to your users. Clear Presence relies on Cloudflare, which uses edge caching, so content is loaded from the nearest edge server.\nYou can learn more about page performance and load times by visiting ClearPresence.io .\n3. Easy Navigation It should be just as easy for users to navigate the desktop version of your website as it is for them to navigate the mobile version.\nConclusion A website that uses responsive layout, is fast loading, and is easy to navigate is the basis for mobile-friendly design. As more and more users browse the web on their phones this becomes increasingly important.

While a great website is the foundation, what happens off your website is just as important. Off-page Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is how you build authority and drive traffic to your site. In this post, we’ll explore the three pillars of effective off-page SEO and how they can bring long-term, organic growth to your business.\nWhy Off-Page SEO Works for Small Businesses in Utah Evergreen Growth - your traffic climbs month after month, without the sudden drops that come with paid ads or social media posts\nCost-effective - every optimization brings long-term ongoing results\nSaves Time - brings organic leads instead of having to spend lots of time running promotions and marketing campaigns\nThe 3 Pillars of Effective Off Page Search Engine Optimization Local SEO is different from broad SEO in that it focuses on three core areas: Relevance, Prominence, and Proximity. The chart below shows the factors that influence lead generation for local businesses.\nSource: Percentages are based on the average percentages given by ChatGPT (o4-mini-high) and Gemini (2.5 Flash) after performing Deep Research. Their results differed by an average of 6 percentage points for each of the factors.\n1. Relevance Relevance is how well your content aligns with what the user is searching for. When setting up your website and/or blog, we want each page to match search intent. We do this by researching the keywords your customers are using and aligning them with your offerings. For local SEO, we also use location-based modifiers targeting a specific city or region. This helps you rank higher in that area and shows customers that your content is relevant to their needs. The title tag and H1 tag are the clearest indicators to Google of what your webpage is about. Your other headings and content should support these tags and add depth. On your Google Business Profile, your relevance is determined primarily by your primary category (this is the most critical relevance signal). Other relevance factors include:\nSecondary categories\nBusiness name\nServices/products listed\nYour website content, which Google uses to assess Google Business Profile relevance\n2. Prominence Prominence is the authority of your content. For websites and blogs, it’s heavily influenced by the quantity and quality of backlinks, citations, and social shares. Links act as popularity votes in the eyes of Google. While all quality (non-spammy) backlinks are helpful, local backlinks from businesses or people in your area are the most impactful. They tie your website/blog to your target location.Another factor that influences the prominence of your website/blog is technical SEO, which focuses on the structure and performance of your website/blog:\nFaster load times: Improves user experience and rankings\nMobile-friendly design: Google prioritizes this\nClear structure: Helps search engines crawl and index effectively\nFor your Google Business Profile, prominence is determined by how engaging your profile is to the public, the number of reviews you have, and your average rating. The top three Google Business Profile listings often appear above websites in local searches, making it a powerful tool.\n3. Proximity Proximity refers to how close a potential customer is to your business. You’ll naturally rank higher in search results for users who are physically closer to your Utah location. However, high relevance and prominence can extend your reach.\nSummary Relevance, prominence, and proximity are the three pillars of local SEO in Utah. Your website, blog, and Google Business Profile are the most powerful tools you have. When combined with analytics, you’ll know where to improve and grow.\nReach Out Visit Clear Presence for Utah Search Engine Optimization Services .\n","permalink":"/blog/off-page-search-engine-optimization-utah/","summary":"As a freelance web designer, I’m dedicated to helping small businesses in Utah succeed online.

As a freelance web designer, I specialize in helping small businesses like yours improve their online presence. A critical piece of that puzzle is on-page Search Engine Optimization (SEO). This post will walk you through the essential on-page SEO techniques that will help your website rank higher in search results and attract more customers.\nOn-Page SEO Strategy for Small Businesses If your website is not aligned with what your customers are searching for you won’t even show up in the search results. The basis of keyword research is finding keywords with high search volume and low competition so you can rank high for those searches. Professional tools give you the best results and Clear Presence uses industry‑leading tools to give you the best results.\nTitle Tag The title tag is the most important signal you provide to Google on what your page is about. Use your keyword research to determine a title with keywords that have good volume and are easy to rank for. Do not worry too much about the length of the title. Conventional wisdom is to make your title tag under 60 characters but recent case studies show that longer titles do not hurt your results.\nMeta Description The meta description is used to summarize your page and is where you speak directly to your audience. Do not worry about using keywords in this description as it does not affect your pages rankings. The only purpose of this description is to help people understand what your page is about and decide if they want to click. The meta description shows up in the search results under your title tag.\nURL Slugs URL slugs should be simple and keyword-rich. One common practice is to use the same url as your title.\nHeadings (H1-H3) Your page should have one H1 that tells your visitors what the page is about. It should match or be closely related to your title tag. It is often the largest or first headline on your page.\nYour H2 and H3 headlines are used to support your H1. While you only use one H1 per page, you can and should organize your content with multiple H2 and H3 tags.\nYour H1 and H2 and H3 headings have a large impact on your SEO and you want to use keywords that support your title tag keywords. In your research you want to identify you main keyword and also a list of related supporting keywords to use in your headlines and text. Your keywords should be natural throughout the content.\nImage Optimization The images for your Utah business should be compressed and optimally use modern formats like AVIF or WebP. Images are one of the largest determinants of your page loading speed. Every image on your page will be downloaded by the browser of the device visiting that page. Ideally you want your images to be less than 150 KB in size.\nImage Keywords The Alt-text on your image is used for those who use screen readers to browse your website and is also used by search engines to understand your images. You use the alt-text to describe your images and can naturally include your keywords in this description.\nPage Speed The three biggest culprits of slow page loading times are unoptimized images images, too many scripts (javascript or tracking tools), and no caching or slow hosting.\nMany modern editors let you lazy-load your images. This means they don’t load until they come into view. This can greatly improve how fast your pages load.\nThe same is true for scripts. Scripts can be edited to delay loading using defer.
