# Our Story

Hunger Ring was created by us, **Courtney** and **Benjamin**.

We've both experienced the gap between knowing what to do and actually doing it. In our own journeys with health and mindfulness, we realized we didn't need another rule or app—we just needed a simple, consistent reminder to pause and listen to our bodies.

We wanted a tool that was beautiful, screen-free, and always with us. Something that could serve as a gentle nudge to check in before making a choice. That idea became the Hunger Ring.

## Listen to Your Body, Feed the World

Our mission is built on two core beliefs:

1.  **Mindful check-ins create lasting change.** Small moments of awareness, repeated over time, are more powerful than any strict plan.
2.  **Generosity should be built-in.** We wanted our work to have a direct, positive impact, which is why **$1 from every ring sold is donated** to help feed the hungry.

Hunger Ring is our small contribution to a more mindful and generous world.
