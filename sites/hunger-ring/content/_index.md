## Listen to Your Body

Many of us eat while lost in thought or emotion, disconnected from the signals of our bodies. This ring is designed to help you **listen to your body**.

By pausing to **turn the ring to align with your hunger**, you create a small but powerful moment of awareness. Seeing your hunger reflected on your ring anchors you in the moment, helping you honor your body’s signals until listening becomes second nature — and the ring is no longer needed.

Hunger Ring is a quiet, physical reminder to pause, check in with your body, and make a choice that serves you.

It’s not another app or a strict plan. It’s a simple tool to help you build a more intuitive relationship with food and your own well-being.

- **Provide a Meal**: For every ring sold, we donate **$1** to help feed the hungry.
- **Try it Out**: Take a month to find your rhythm. If the Hunger Ring isn't for you, we offer **30-day returns** (buyer pays return shipping).
