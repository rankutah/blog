Many of us eat while lost in thought or emotion, disconnected from the subtle signals of our bodies. This ring is designed to help **bring your mind and body back into alignment**.

By pausing to rotate the ring to match the sensations in your stomach, you create a small but powerful moment of awareness. Seeing your hunger reflected on your finger anchors that you in that moment, helping you **honor your body’s signals and support intuitive eating** — until your body’s cues are clear and the ring is no longer needed.

Hunger Ring is a quiet, physical reminder to pause, check in with your body, and make a choice that serves you.

It’s not another app or a strict plan. It’s a simple tool to help you build a more intuitive relationship with food and your own well-being.

- **Provide a Meal:** For every ring sold, we donate  **$1** to help feed the hungry.
- **Try it Risk-Free:** We offer **30-day returns** (buyer pays return shipping).

## FAQs

{{< faqs schema="true" >}}

### Is Hunger Ring a medical device?

No. Hunger Ring is a simple awareness tool and is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.

If you have a medical condition, are pregnant, or have a history of disordered eating, consider checking in with a qualified healthcare professional before making changes.

### Can Hunger Ring help with weight loss?

Hunger Ring isn’t a weight‑loss product or diet plan.

Some people find that practicing awareness around hunger, fullness, and habits helps them make different choices over time, but results vary and we don’t promise specific outcomes.

If weight loss is your goal, Hunger Ring can support the “pause and notice” part of the process—but it’s not a guarantee and it’s not medical advice.

### How do I use it?

Use it as a quick check‑in cue before, during, and after eating.

1) Pause for a few seconds.
2) Rotate the ring to match what your stomach feels like in that moment.
3) Honor what you notice—eat, stop, slow down, get water, take a break, or simply wait.

### Who is Hunger Ring for?

Anyone who wants a simple, screen‑free reminder to stop eating on autopilot and practice presence.

It’s especially helpful if you like tools that are gentle, consistent, and easy to use in everyday life.

### Where does the donation go?

For every ring sold, we donate **$1** to help feed the hungry.

We’re committed to giving as a built‑in part of each purchase. Donation destinations and timing may vary.
