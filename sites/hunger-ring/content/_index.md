## FAQs

{{< faqs schema="true" >}}

### Can Hunger Ring help with weight loss?

Hunger Ring is not a weight‑loss product, diet plan, or medical device.

Some people find that building more awareness around hunger, fullness, and habits can support changes over time, but results vary and we don’t promise specific outcomes.

If you have a medical condition or a history of disordered eating, consider talking with a qualified healthcare professional before making changes.

### How do I use it?

Use it as a check‑in cue (before eating, while snacking, or any time you feel stuck).

Take a breath, notice what you’re feeling, and decide what you need next—food, water, a break, movement, or simply a moment.

### Who is Hunger Ring for?

Anyone who wants a simple, non-digital reminder to pause and check in.

It’s especially helpful if you like tools that are gentle, consistent, and easy to use in everyday life.

### Where does the donation go?

For every ring sold, we donate **$1** to help feed the hungry.

We’re committed to giving as a built‑in part of each purchase.

### What is your return policy?

We offer **30‑day returns**.

The buyer is responsible for return shipping.
