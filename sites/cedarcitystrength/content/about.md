### Hanna

Hanna is hungry for fitness and brings that energy into every class she coaches. Her fitness journey began when falling short of making a team motivated her to find new ways to improve, and she found herself in a high school gym competing in Olympic lifting and powerlifting. This sparked her lifelong passion for strength training.

While earning degrees in Exercise Science and Nutrition, and becoming a certified personal trainer, Hanna discovered CrossFit and quickly fell in love with the challenge and community. She has been at CCSC for two years and loves seeing the satisfaction on members’ faces after completing a challenging workout.

Hanna is here to meet you where you’re at and help you build strength, confidence, and consistency. She also offers nutrition assessments to support your goals both inside and outside the gym.
