## Why Are Gutters Important in the First Place

Before getting into the unique advantages of seamless gutters in Boca Raton, FL, it is important to take a step back to understand why gutters are important in the first place. Whenever it rains in the Boca Raton area, a substantial amount of water is collected on your roof. The specific architecture of your home, particularly roof valleys, will channel this water into a stream. Without a gutter system in place, this heavy flow of water will cascade off the side of your room in an uncontrolled fashion.

Over time, repetitive strong streams of water can cause substantial damage to your property. If the stream hits the side of your home, it can harm your paint, siding, fascia, soffit, doors, and windows. As the water pools around your property, it can erode landscaping and cause damage to the foundation of your Boca Raton residence. A properly designed and installed gutter system will eliminate all of these problems.

## Seamless Gutters Prevent the Development of Leaks

One of the primary benefits of a seamless gutter system is that it will not develop leaks overtime. Traditional gutters were manufactured in segments. When they were installed, these gutters were kept together and watertight through sealants. After heavy use, the sealant can wash away and leaks can form in your gutters. In contrast, seamless gutters minimize the chances of leaks occurring because there are far fewer areas that must rely on sealants.

## Seamless Gutters in Boca Raton Prevent Clogs

One of the most common problems that occurs with gutters is that they will becom clogged with leafs, twigs, and debris. Traditional segmented gutters are highly prone to clogs because the areas in which the segments are connected present a point where debris can snag and collect.
