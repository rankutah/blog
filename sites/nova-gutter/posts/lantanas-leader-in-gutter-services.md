## What Makes Seamless Gutters the Better Choice

You have two types of gutters to choose from: sectional and [**seamless gutters**](https://www.novagutter.com/seamless-gutter-installation-boca-raton-fl.php). Many customers call us for Lantana gutter company services to get help deciding which kind they should have.

If you’re curious about the benefits of going seamless, here are some things you should know about.

*   Most gutter leaks occur at the seams. That means if you do away with the seams you do away with the leaks. That also means less places for damage like rust to form so that you can expect a longer lifespan and better performance from your gutters.
    
*   You can’t get any more custom fit than seamless gutters. Since they are literally made to measure and will fit your home perfectly. This also means you need expert installation because this is not the type of precise work you can DIY.
    
*   They just look better and make your home’s exterior look better. The choices you make for your house should improve the overall visual aesthetics.
