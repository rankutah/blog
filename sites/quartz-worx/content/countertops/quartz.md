# Quartz Countertops

Engineered stone made from natural quartz and resins. Offers consistent colors and patterns, excellent durability, and low maintenance.

**Pros**
- Extremely durable and chip‑resistant
- Non‑porous; resists staining without sealing
- Wide range of consistent colors and patterns

**Cons**
- Less heat‑tolerant than some natural stones (use trivets)
- Not suitable for outdoor UV exposure

**Care**
- Clean with mild soap and water; avoid abrasive pads
- Use cutting boards and trivets to protect the surface
