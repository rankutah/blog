# Granite Countertops

We stock 20 colors of granite and other natural stone in our yard. The best price that we can give you is from our in-stock slabs. We can also bring in your slab selections from any of the slab suppliers.

Natural stone prized for its unique movement and durability. Every slab is one‑of‑a‑kind, adding character and a unique look to your space.

**Pros**
- Highly heat‑resistant; great for active kitchens
- Scratch‑resistant and very durable
- Unique natural patterns and colors

**Cons**
- Requires periodic sealing (typically once every 3 years)
- Natural variation means pattern/vein selection matters

**Care**
- Clean with stone‑safe cleaner or mild soap; reseal as recommended
- Use cutting boards to protect your knives
- Wipe spills promptly
