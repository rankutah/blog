# Marble Countertops

Timeless luxury with dramatic veining and a soft sheen. Loved for its patina over time; best with informed care.

**Pros**
- Classic, high‑end aesthetic
- Naturally cool surface—great for baking
- Ages with a unique patina many homeowners love

**Cons**
- Softer surface can scratch and etch
- Sensitive to acids (lemon, vinegar) and some cleaners
- Needs regular sealing

**Care**
- Clean with pH‑neutral stone cleaner; avoid acidic/abrasive products
- Blot spills quickly; use cutting boards and coasters
