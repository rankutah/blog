# Quartzite Countertops

Metamorphic natural stone known for its hardness and marble‑like veining—great when you want natural stone beauty with added durability.

**Pros**
- Very hard and scratch‑resistant
- Handles heat better than many man‑made surfaces
- Elegant, often marble‑like appearance

**Cons**
- Typically requires sealing
- Limited color range vs. engineered quartz
- Some varieties can etch with strong acids if not well sealed

**Care**
- Use a pH‑neutral cleaner; reseal per manufacturer recommendations
- Use trivets for very hot pots; wipe acidic spills promptly
