Whether you're into hiking, photography, scenic drives, or underground adventures, this guide will help you make the most of your trip during peak foliage season.





## 1. Cruise the Blue Ridge Parkway

The [**Blue Ridge Parkway**](https://www.blueridgeparkway.org) is one of America’s most iconic scenic drives—and fall is when it truly shines.

**Don’t Miss:** Sunset views from one of the many overlooks on the parkway, like Chimney Rock Mountain Overlook (10 minutes) or Irish Creek Valley Overlook (15 minutes). Enjoy a picnic at Yankee Horse Ridge (30 minutes).





## 2. Explore the Appalachian Waters Scenic Byway

Follow **Route 39** west from Buena Vista and you’ll wind through **Goshen Pass**, where the Maury River flows beneath cliffs and canopies of golden leaves. Known as the [**Appalachian Waters Scenic Byway**](https://www.virginia.org/listing/route-39-appalachian-waters-scenic-byway/7043/), this drive is a favorite for photographers, cyclists, and anyone seeking peaceful beauty.

**Best Stops:** Pull off at picnic areas or explore short trails near the river for an immersive leaf-peeping experience.





## 3. Chase Waterfalls

## 4. Go Below Ground to Explore Virginia’s Caverns

Autumn above, adventure below! The Shenandoah Valley is home to some of the oldest and most dramatic caverns in the country, perfect for a fall day when the weather is less agreeable.
