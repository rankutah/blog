## About

*   [Arrow LeftBack](#about)

The Blue Ridge Abbey has stood as a welcoming presence in Buena Vista for well over a century. Originally known as the Jordan House, this beautiful home has been a part of the town‚Äôs story since its earliest days. Some records date its construction to 1898, while local stories consistently suggest it may have been completed in 1903.Whichever date is true, one thing is certain: this home is a cherished piece of Buena Vista‚Äôs history and heart.Built by Charles Francis Jordan Jr., the son of a respected war veteran, adaptive businessman, trusted leader, and honored statesman, the Jordan House was created to be a gathering place in the community. Improvements to the house, including the iconic wrap-around porch and the Carriage House, were added in the mid-1900s as the needs of the family and community expanded. Ms. Mabelle Jordan, daughter of the builders, witnessed its construction as a child and lived here until she passed away in 1998 at age 104. The property then passed to the Wilhelms, who loved, maintained, and perpetuated the significance of this landmark building until it was purchased by the current owners.As we‚Äôve restored this home and opened it once more to guests, we have been delighted to hear so many stories from local residents of events, celebrations, and significant moments shared here over the years. We are careful to preserve the original quality while updating and renovating it to meet the highest standards of comfort, quality, and decor, and we are excited to welcome you to stay and take part in the next chapter in the story of this historic home!We are men and women of the community who believe in beautifying, building, and befriending. As close friends and family, we have worked together to create a bed and breakfast where you can be assured of comfort, cleanliness, and modern convenience while enjoying the Victorian-style historic home and the vintage garden design.
