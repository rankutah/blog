### Origins (1898–1903)
Originally known as the Jordan House, the Abbey has been part of Buena Vista’s story since the town’s early days. Records date its construction to 1898, while local stories suggest it may have been completed around 1903.

### A Community Landmark
The home was built by Charles Francis Jordan Jr., and soon became a gathering place for events and celebrations. The iconic wrap-around porch and the Carriage House were added in the mid-1900s as needs grew. Ms. Mabelle Jordan, daughter of the builders, saw its construction as a child and lived here for over a century.

### Today’s Abbey
Lovingly preserved and carefully updated, the Abbey blends the warmth of its history with modern comfort. We’re delighted to welcome guests and to hear local stories of meaningful moments shared here. We continue to restore and improve the property with comfort, quality, and decor in mind.
