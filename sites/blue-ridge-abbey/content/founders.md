She was born in Sweden and moved to America after marrying Daniel De Souza, whom she met at church. She holds a degree in industrial design and, when she’s not caring for her family, she helps others with interior design projects. She loves the outdoors, traveling, and experiencing new foods, countries, and cultures. She shared that designing the interior of the bed and breakfast was both exciting and deeply rewarding. Restoring such a beautiful structure has been a true blessing.{{< /col >}}
