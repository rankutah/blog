# Founders

Blue Ridge Abbey was founded with a vision to offer a welcoming, thoughtful guest experience rooted in the beauty of the Blue Ridge region.

We’ll share more of our story, inspiration, and the journey behind the Abbey here soon. In the meantime, we’d love to host you — explore our rooms and availability.
